Colleges likewise are secondary or even tertiary for man thinking; they look backward and not forward; \"they pin me down.\" But Emerson believed also that greatness appeals its case to the future. Ironically enough, his own assault on posterity has been so successful that twentieth-century Ameri- cans turn from their own thinking to read his essays and, no less paradoxically, our colleges make his writings part of their curricula. Thus professors of literature agree with Matthiessen of Har- vard when he credits Emerson with a frontal attack on the major problem of the artist, nanlely, how shall he simultaneously express himself and communicate with society. Professors of social history nod assent when Gabriel of Yale characterizes him as the Isaiah of his age. And professors of philosophy, even though they often deny that Emerson is", "frontal attack on the major problem of the artist, nanlely, how shall he simultaneously express himself and communicate with society. Professors of social history nod assent when Gabriel of Yale characterizes him as the Isaiah of his age. And professors of philosophy, even though they often deny that Emerson is a systematic philoso- pher, merely raise an eyebrow when Dewey of Columbia praises him as master of a finely wrought logic and as the philosopher of democracy. These paradoxes, however, would cause Emerson no distress if he were living today; he believed that books and colleges when rightly used can accomplish an indispensable end. But they serve us only \"when they aim not to drill but to create\"-when they gather frolll afar every ray of genius and, by their concen- trated fires, set the Ileart of man on flame. Emerson's o'vn utterances were and are provocative, at times even infiamlnatory. (Ludwig Lewisohn remarked that opinions . lX X F'ORE WORD much less subversive of the political and the moral order than Emerson held have repeatedly sent men to jail or into exile.) Or in his own words, \"Your goodness must have some edge to it.\" His doctrines of edged and dangerous goodness Emerson underscored in his essays by reiteration and by paraphrase, driving home each point with the same quiet ins~stence that made hinl an unspectacular but unforgettable publIc lecturer. Occasional readers who take Emerson to be merely an an1iable clergyman writing platitudes may mistake abstractness of thought for its absence. Or they may be misled by the blandness with which Enlerson often presents his most explosive ideas. And they are perhaps further confused by his honest readiness to modify or contradict his own pronouncements when he comes upon a new aspect of truth. In reality Emerson was fronl the", "absence. Or they may be misled by the blandness with which Enlerson often presents his most explosive ideas. And they are perhaps further confused by his honest readiness to modify or contradict his own pronouncements when he comes upon a new aspect of truth. In reality Emerson was fronl the r830'S to the Civil War the most urbane deviser of intellect uaI bombshells in the United States. Today his pages are strewn \",ith harmless fragments of ex- ploded shells but hidden an10ng them lie delayed action bombg which burst from time to time in the reader's face. When, for example, Emerson reconciles Christianity and the Romantic Movement by announcing that the universe has its center in God and at the same time in the individual mall, he may be fighting a long-lost battle. But his essays do more than supply materials for the study of the .~merican past. In them the reader finds not only pronouncements which once were wisdol11 and now are foolishness but dicta which are as valid in our century as they were in his. Envy is still ignorance and itnitation still suicide; artists are, as they were to Emerson, liberating gods who free man through symboIisnl; if we accept fate, we are still no less compelled to accept liberty. i\\nd, since Emerson like his contemporaries Hawthorne and Melville wrote l1lore wisely than he knew, his essays carry meanings decipherable only by the future. Emerson, in other words, must be approached critically. To aU docile readers trained to accept the voice of authority, he says: Lay this volume down. You had better never see my essays than to be warped by their attraction out of your own orbit and made my satellite.

You had better never see my essays than to be warped by their attraction out of your own orbit and made my satellite. INTRODUCTION By BROOKS ATKINSON I RALPH WALDO EMERSON was the first philosopher of the Ameri~ can spirit. Although America had won its political independence twenty-two years before he was born it still took its culture from abroad. Cooper was writing in the tradition of Scott; Washington Irving was writing in the style of Addison. Emerson lived his early life in an expansionist period when Americans were pushing west in unprecedented numbers and acting upon the principle of democracy with considerable swagger and gusto. Complete inde- pendence in spirit as well as in fact was everywhere in the air. President Monroe had given public notice of it in his Doctrine of I823. Clay had boldly declared: \"We look too much abroad, .\u2022. Let us become real and true Americans.\" What the statesmen had already accomplisbed in the sphere of politics Emerson applied to culture, not by action, but by exhor- tation and radiance. \"Our age is retrospective,\" he said in the introduction to his first book in 1836. \"Why should not we alsu enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of tradition and a religion by revelation to us? ... Let us demand our own works and laws and worship.\" In a courageous address on \"The Ameri- can Scholar\" in the next year he said: \"We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe\"; and he counseled the scholars assembled in Cambridge to live and think like free men.

In the next year he spoke out against formalism and tradition in reli .. gion. What he said in that address was so abhorrent to many peo- ple in Boston and Cambridge that nearly thirty years went by before Harvard University felt that he was a safe man to have around again. xi xii INTRODUCTION N at that he had a program of action or a system of thought. He was a poetic philosopher who trusted inspiration more than reason, and he was always painfully aware of a lack of continuity in his lectures and essays. He could not argue. As much as pas ... sible he avoided speaking on matters of current importance, for he believed that his talents were for enlightenment ill general. But spiritually and intellectually he was a man of such freedom, per- sonally he was a man of such exalted character that his influence was great and wide and he enkindled the minds of men and women all around the world. He wa5 a man of deliberate affirma- tions. Since his basic topic was the infinite capacities of the pri ... vate man, partaking of the whole range of the universe, his ,\u00a5rit ... ings remain as fresh as they were when he laboriously assembled them out of random thoughts and evanescent flashes of insight. II Strictly speaking, he was a radical. But it was hard to think so, for he was mild, frail, friendly and of civil demeanor, and he lived quietly in Concord, Mass., like the most respected of citizens.

But it was hard to think so, for he was mild, frail, friendly and of civil demeanor, and he lived quietly in Concord, Mass., like the most respected of citizens. He came of a long line of New England clergymen and was a member of a family that instinctively inclined toward the min- istry .. He was born in Boston on May 25, 1803, son of the pastor of the Second Church and one of five brothers. His father died eight years later: Although his mother was left with a growing fami1y and in desperate financial circumstances, she was a woman of great singleness of purpose and she determined that her boys should be educated. She succeeded. Four of them went through college, each one helping the next one who was ready. It was a hard, driving life that doubtless left-its mark on the health of the children, for two of them died when they were still young men. Ralph's health was never vigorous; on two occasions it was dangerously bad, and his elder brother was never wholly free from pain and physical anxiety. Apparently the Emerson stock was not robust in Ralph's generation. A brother and sister died as children; another brother never mentally matured. The priva\u00b7. tions of the Emerson family after the death of Emerson's father bore particularly hard 6n unsound constitutions. ... INTRODUCTION XU1 Emerson entered Harvard College in 1817 at the age of four- teen. Although he was in the upper half of his class he did not distinguish himself. He was graduated in 1821. For four years he helped his brother teach a finishing school for young ladies in Boston. After teaching school in other communities he entered Harvard", "the age of four- teen. Although he was in the upper half of his class he did not distinguish himself. He was graduated in 1821. For four years he helped his brother teach a finishing school for young ladies in Boston. After teaching school in other communities he entered Harvard Divinity School, but weak lungs and eyes and rheuma- tism interrupted his education for the ministry almost at once and he had to spend a winter recuperating in the South. After completing his education, in 1829, he was ordained as assistant pastor of the Second Church, where his father had preached, and soon succeeded the pastor in full charge of the parish. At this time he married Ellen Tucker of Concord, N. H., but she lived only a year and a half afterward. The formal customs of religious ob- servance had always been somewhat distasteful to Emerson. In 1832 he announced to his congregation that he could no longer administer the sacrament conscientiously because be did not be- lieve that Christ had intended it as a general, regular observance. The sermon he preached on that subject is included in this vol .. ume. Although he was well liked in his parish, the church decided that it could not dispense with the Lord's Supper, and Emerson resigned in circumstances that were friendly on both sides. Disappointed in his professional life, troubled by the death of his wife and also the death of one of his brothers and in poor health himself, he sailed for Italy in the winter. The trip restored his health. It also stimulated his mind. He took joy in the great art treasures of Italy; he visited Landor, whose writing he ad .. mired.

He took joy in the great art treasures of Italy; he visited Landor, whose writing he ad .. mired. In England he sought out Coleridge, Wordsworth and Carlyle, whose works had especially interested him. The visit to Carlyle was a signal event in his life, for he found Carlyle as stim .. ulating and congenial in person as he was in his works. Returning to America in good health a year later he finally settled in Con ... cord, where his step\"'grandfather, Dr. Ezra Ripley, was living in the Old Manse. Presently Emerson bought a house and land on the Boston Post Road, married Lidian Jackson of Plymouth and settled down to a happy life that developed into a great career~ He was thirty-two years old. All the privations of his early life and the spiritual conflicts of his prnfessionallife were over. For \u2022 XIV INTRODUCTION the next forty-seven years he grew in grace and wisdom and min- istered to the world. Concord was the ideal town for him. It was beautiful. It in- dulged the love of nature that lay at the bottom of his philosophy. It had an honorable place in the story of America's fight for inde- pendence; the battle of Concord had been fought near the Old Manse, and Emerson's imagination was exhilarated by the illus- trious history of the town. The social life in Concord was also attractive. During his lifetime it included Bronson Alcott, the Orphic schoolmaster, Nathaniel Hawthorne, the shy, reclusive novelist, Henry Thoreau, the bachelor of nature, William Ellery Channing, the poet and conversationalist, such worthies as Samuel Hoar and Judge E. R. Hoar, Edmund Hosmer, the high- minded farmer, and Rev.

R. Hoar, Edmund Hosmer, the high- minded farmer, and Rev. Ezra Ripley, the powerful and consci- entious parson. Emerson took an active part in town life. He was elected hog- reeve when'he first settled in Concot.:d. He was a member of the Fire Association; the leather buckets and baize bag always hung over the stairs in the side entry, and in company with his neigh ... bors he fought wood fires with pine boughs. When he was still new to the town he delivered one of the most important historical addresses at the two-hundredth anniversary of the settlement of Concord. Occasionally he supplied the local pulpit. The Sunday school teachers met with Mrs. Emerson in their front parlor. i\\.S a director of the Concord Athenaeum he helped maintain a public reading room where newspapers and magazines were kept on file. By keeping the Lyceum active he and Thoreau stimulated the intellectual life of Concord. His whole being flourished there. He planted a garden and worked in it, begrudging the time he had to spend in the study, He planted an orchard of which he was inordinately proud. Even- tually he bought more land and ran a little farm with hired labor. Falling in love with the Walden woods he bought a tract of land there purely for enjoyment. Thoreau built his celebrated hermit .. age in Emerson's woods. Concord was also near Boston which dominated the intellectual life of America in those days.

The stagecoach lumbered by Emerson's house and r{;ached Boston in INTRODUCTION xv two or three hours; and presently the Fitchburg Railroad brought Boston much nearer. Altogether Concord was an ideal commu- nity for a man of Emerson's temperament. He loved it in his youth when he visited Dr. Ripley at the Old l\\fanse; he always loved it, and in time Concord loved him as the grand old man of the town. When he first settled in his own house with his young wife, be filled pulpits here and there and made occasional addresses. But be had for some time been contemplating a poetic book of phi- losophy about the fundamental influence of Nature on the life of mankind. Nature, he called it simply. He finished and published it in 1836. Five hundred copies were published anonymously. Although Carlyle hailed it, especially as a ground-plan for great 'and true building, it was not enlhusiastically received and was not reprinted until 1847. But Emerson had begun his life's work. His address on \"The American Scholar\" before the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1837 was a stirring event in the history of American culture. \"Our intellectual Declaration of Independ- ence,\" Oliver Wendell Holmes called it. It excited the young men particularly, and the address in printed form was eagerly bought in large numbers as soon as it appeared on the bookstalls. The next year Emerson addressed the graduating class of the Divinity School, disputing the true value of historical Christianity and inveighing against the formal and uninspired style of pulpit addresses. This criticism of the ministry and religious thought met with ~'ndignant", "numbers as soon as it appeared on the bookstalls. The next year Emerson addressed the graduating class of the Divinity School, disputing the true value of historical Christianity and inveighing against the formal and uninspired style of pulpit addresses. This criticism of the ministry and religious thought met with ~'ndignant opposition among the clergy. It was de- nounc\u20ac'~ as heresy. Emerson was branded an atheist, and he was no longer welcome in pulpits and on lecture platforms that had been hospitable to him. Although he took no part in the contro- versy that raged around his head for several months, he thought for a time that he might have to find a new way of life to support himself and his falnily. Eut he soon discovered that people would listen receptively on Wednesday to things that seemed like blasphemy on Sunday. He spent the rest of his life lecturing chiefly on spiritual and phil .. osophical subjects all over the country .. During the sumn1ers he assembled his thoughts in the form of addresses. \"Are you ill?\" \u2022 ~'CVl INTRODUCTION his wife inquired when he got up at dawn and stole out of the room. \"No, only catching a thought,\" he replied. In the winters he read the lectures wherever he was invited-traveling by car- riage, sleigh, canal boat, steamboat, and train through N e\\v England, the Atlantic States and the l\\1iddle West, staying in all sorts of primitive hotels, crossing the Mississippi on the ice, and keenly enjoying the developing life of the country. Although he was a man of slender body with sloping shoulders, he was an effective public speaker. His benign personality was attractive. His voice had astonishing volume.

Although he was a man of slender body with sloping shoulders, he was an effective public speaker. His benign personality was attractive. His voice had astonishing volume. He was a generally recognized master of the art of oratory. The life of lecturing was arduous; since Emerson was a poor business man and usually spoke for any fee that was offered he never earned much money_ But he was of a naturally hopeful temperament, easily believing the best of everything and he was buoyed up all his life by sublime faith. The duty of the scholar, he believed, was t'to -:beer, to raise and to guide men by showing them facts among appearances.\" As he traveled about the coun- try, '~emptying his decanters and demijohns of popular wisdom,\" as he termed his lectures, he felt that he was enriching the lives of human beings and doing the work that suited his genius. When he had tried his lectures on various audiences he rewrote them as essays and published them in book form. Almost all his writings, e..l;:cept the poetry, were first spokeu from the lecture platform. Not everyone understood what he was talking about, or ap- proved. Young people seemed to follow him more easily than their elders. A Boston attorney said Emerson's lectures \"are utterly meaningless to me, but my daughters, aged 15 and 17, understand them thoroughly.\" \"Do you understand Mr. Emer- son?\" lvlrs. Hoar inquired of a scrubwoman who always attended Emerson's lectures in Concord. \"Not a word,\" the scrubwoman replied; \"but I like to go and see him stand up there and look as though he thought everyone was as good as he was.\" A Concord fanner boasted that he had heard all of Emerson's lectures at the ~y~eum and \"understood 'em,", "in Concord. \"Not a word,\" the scrubwoman replied; \"but I like to go and see him stand up there and look as though he thought everyone was as good as he was.\" A Concord fanner boasted that he had heard all of Emerson's lectures at the ~y~eum and \"understood 'em, too.\" One of Concord's leading CItIzens understood them clearly enough to object to their radi- calism. \"There are only three persons so far as I know whose \u2022\u2022 INTRODUCTION XVll opinions are obnoxious to this community,\" he told Emerson on the street one day. ~~They are Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips and-if I may be so candid-yourself, sir!\" After more than ten years of exhausting scholarship and lectur- tng, Einerson was very glad in 1847 to accept an invitation to read son1e of his lectures in England. He spent a year there. Trav- eling around England he had an opportunity to become inti- mately acquainted with Inany kinds of English people. As an American celebrity he was freely invited and cordially received in English homes. He renewed his old friendships, particularly with Carlyle, who had grown a little crusty through the years. He also visited France during a period of great political unrest. English Traits, which is at once a history and psychological an ... alysis of the English character, was the chief result of his busy year abroad. Although he was a lovable man, he was shy, modest and deficient in animal spirits, and he felt that he was too cold for social intercourse. During his school-teaching days his embarrass ... ment was painful and the students took humorous advantage of it. The personal visits expected of a pastor were also a trial for him. He did not dominate groups by force of personality. Hi~ best thinking was done in", "cold for social intercourse. During his school-teaching days his embarrass ... ment was painful and the students took humorous advantage of it. The personal visits expected of a pastor were also a trial for him. He did not dominate groups by force of personality. Hi~ best thinking was done in private. But the period in which he lived was one of extraordinary social ferment; reformers were dragging the world up by its roots and making cults out of eccen- tricities. That was the period of the philosophical committees- Brook Farm and Fruit-lands. As the leading transcendental philosopher of the day, Emerson was consulted and implored by everyone who had a new system, by the genuine prophets as well as the cranks and crackpots. They all came to his house, sat at his table and were hospitably received. But Emerson, having no taste for community enterprises, steadfastly dissociated hinlself from them. To him they seemed like one-sided affirmations. Politically he was reluctant. From the first he had believed that the slaves should be freed. But he avoided as long as possible the radical societies that were promoting abolition. When he was urged to take part in direct action he said: \"I have my own spirits in prison-spirits in deeper prisons-whom no man visits if I do ... XVlll INTRODUCTION not.\" But as the slavery clamor increased Emerson began to join in it. When the Fugitive Slave Law was passed, and Emerson be- lieved that his hero, Daniel Webster. had betrayed public trust, Emerson appeared at public meetings in Concord, Boston and New York and spoke with a bitterness strange in so serene a per- son. In spite of the fact that all ;his instincts were against taking part in political action and in spite of his distrust of his own knowledge", "trust, Emerson appeared at public meetings in Concord, Boston and New York and spoke with a bitterness strange in so serene a per- son. In spite of the fact that all ;his instincts were against taking part in political action and in spite of his distrust of his own knowledge of practical affairs, he actively associated himself with the cause of abolition after the Fugitive Slave Law was passed. Once he observed to one of his children, who had to write a school essay on building a house, that no house should be built without having in it a space to hide a runaway slave. He enter- tained John Brown ir! his house, contributed to the cause of aboli- tion beyr .ld his means and spoke in defense of John Brown after Harper's Ferry. He was fifty-seven years of age when the Civil War broke out and he took no part in the fighting. In 1865 Emerson was invited to make the Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard again. By this time Harvard had forgotten the scandal of the Baccalaureate Sermon of 1838. Shortly after- ward he was selected as a member of the Board of Overseers. In 1870 and I87I he lectured on philosophy at Harvard. But be was well on in years; the strain of a lifetime of persistent intellec- tual activity had begun to tell on him. His memory was failing. \\, He was approaching the end of a great career. In July, I 872, his house was partially destroyed by fire; he and Mrs. Emerson had to tun for their lives without having time to dress, and they over- taxed their strength in trying to save some of their possessions.

The shock of this calamity was more than Emerson could throw off. It very nearly prostrated him. He was taken again to the Old ~fanse, where he had enjoyed himself as a boy, and a study was fitted up for him in the village. But it soon became apparent that he could not work. At length some of his friends intervened. They sent him to Egypt ,vith his daughter, Ellen, and during his absence they rebuilt and re- stored his house. 'V\"hen he returned the next March, the town b~ns were rung and a great company of children, neighbors and fnends accompanied him from the railroad station and under a . INTRODUCTION XIX ttiurnphal arch to his new home. He settled down gratefully to prepare a book of essays he had promised to a London publisher, but he was no longer able to make progress with any sustained work. Eventually a friend, James Elliot Cabot, had to put the book together fronl many notes and lectures and get all of Emer- son's papers in good order. Emerson lived a quiet and contented life with his family and friends until April, 1882, when he contracted pneumonia from walking in the rain without a hat or coat. He died on the evening of April 27th. Shortly after 9 o'clock that evening the bell on the Unitarian Church tolled seventy-nine strokes, which counted his age, to announce the doleful news throughout the village ..

Concord, where Emerson had lived as a neighbor for most of his life, knew that her greatest villager was gone. His death was national news; the editorial writers and obituary writers spun out many columns with information and critical esteem. Many distinguished friends came to the funeral on a special train from Boston. President Eliot of Harvard, Oliver Wenden Holmes, George William Curtis, Charles Eliot Norton were there; and Dr. W .. H. Furness, the Philadelphia divine, and the Rev. James Freeman Clarke of Boston read Scripture at the service. But Concord, which loved Emerson as its grandest neighbor, was deeply affect.ed, and the funeral had a local atmospherer Dwelling houses, stores and public buildings were everywhere shrouded in black. In the afternoon, after the private service, thE' villagers followed the hearse from the large house on the Boston Post Road to the old church. Boughs from the pine trees that Emerson had worshiped were piled around the altar. The harp of yellow jonquils in the center was the remembrance of Louisa M. ' Alcott. Judge E. R. Hoar, who was not only a villager but an intjmate neighbor and a member of the famous Saturday Club, spoke for his townsmen in terms of personal affection.

III In philosopby Emerson was a transcendentalist. He believed in the \"over-soul \"-the universal soul of which everything living was a part. Even in Emerson's own day the word \"transcenden- talism\" was considered confusing, and the popular meaning of the word is still \"vague, obscure, visionary.\" Scholars accustomed to exact knowledge could not make head or tail of Emerson's school of thought. That was not surprising. Transcendentalism had no system; it was more poetry than thought. \"What is popularly called transcendentalism among us is idealism,\" Emerson once said. In contrast with the materialist, who reasoned from facts, history and the animal wants of man, the idealist believed in \"the power of thought and of will, in inspiration,-in miracle, in individ- ual culture.\" It was a centrifugal manifestation of faith in God. To a young country just beginning to enjoy its independence and lustily expanding in all directions this c;tyle of thinking was natural and satisfying. It believed that anything could be acconl- plished. Systems of thought and methods of reasoning seemed stifling to people of exultant temperament who were looking on all the fruits of the earth and finding them good.

Systems of thought and methods of reasoning seemed stifling to people of exultant temperament who were looking on all the fruits of the earth and finding them good. It was easy for them to give their intuitions authority over experience. Not what had Been done but what might be done seemed to them the greater ~ruth. Life flowed into the transcendentalist from the flowers, the clouds, the birds, the SUD, the chill and warmth of the weather, the beauty of the evening, and from the farms, the shops and the railroads where life was stirring and good things seemed to be happening. Although Emerson's philosophy was not a system it had some ... thing of a plan in the way he developed it. His attitude toward life was based on his love of nature and is stated in his first book I \u2022 INTRODUCTION XXI Nature. A short book, published anonymously, it was generally dismissed by the reviewers as pantheistic rapture, charmingly written but without much significance. Yet it represented several years of deliberate thought when Emerson was trying to put his ideas in order. He began in the introduction with a definition of terms: \"Nature, in the common sense, refers to essences un- changed by man; space, the air, the river, the leaf. Art is applied to the mixture of his will with the same things, as in a housl., a canal, a statue, a picture.\" He rejoiced that man is part of nature and that nature is his home. The most significant statement he made is that man becomes a part of God when he surrenders him- self to association with nature: \".f become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of", "rejoiced that man is part of nature and that nature is his home. The most significant statement he made is that man becomes a part of God when he surrenders him- self to association with nature: \".f become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circu- late through me; I am part or parcel of God.\" The rest of Nature showed the connection between nature and civilization. Five years later Emerson published his first book of Essays; matie from lectures he had been reading chiefly in Boston. The new book contained the essay on \"The Over-Soul\" which may be regarded as the cornerstone of his faith. In the notes to the com- plete works, Emerson's son has pointed out that the first series of essays derive from a plan set down in the journals: There is one soul. It is related to the world. Art is its action thereon. Science finds its methods. Li tera ture is its record. Religion is the emotion of reverence that it inspires. Ethics is the soul illustrated in human life. Society is the finding of this soul by individuals in each other. Trades are the learning of the soul in nature by labor. Politics is the activity of the soul illustrated in power. Manners are silent a.nd mediate expressions of soul. Apparently Emerson did not lecture on \"The Over-Soul\" spe- cifically. The essay as it appears in his writings was compiled and rewritten from statements in several related lectures. Early \" in the essay Emerson accounts' for the beneficent usages of the soul in the habitual life of the world: ('We grant that human lite \u00b7 . :L,(ll INTRODUCTIO~ is mean, but ho\\v did we find out that it was nlca.t.1?} \"fhe soul sets up an", "several related lectures. Early \" in the essay Emerson accounts' for the beneficent usages of the soul in the habitual life of the world: ('We grant that human lite \u00b7 . :L,(ll INTRODUCTIO~ is mean, but ho\\v did we find out that it was nlca.t.1?} \"fhe soul sets up an jntuitive standard that distinguishes good from bad. From that assertion Emerson proceeds to a description of the Over-Soul: L'Vl e live in succession, in division, in parts, ~n par- ticles. 11eantime within man is the soul of the whoJe; th~ wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 We see the world pier.e by piece, as the sun~ the moon, the anilnai, the tree, but the whole, of which these are the shining parts, is the soul.\" From there it is a logical step to the fruits of the soul: \"When it breathes througb [~an 's] intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his will it is virtue; when it ploughs through his affection\" it is love.\" And, finally, faith in the Over-Sonl gives man immense scope and gives every moment tremendous ~ignificance-\"Man will come to see that the world is the perennial miracle which the soul workcrth, and be less astonished at particular wonders; he will learn that there is no profane history; that all history is sacmct; that the universe is represented in an atom, in a moment of time.\" Not everybody was willing to follow Emerson so far from the ~aterial world into the world of intuition. Identifying man with God seemed like heresy to some of the clergy. Others thought it was mere rhapsody or wishful thinking. And, of course, nlany .aardheaded men did not know what he was talking about. But the effect of", "so far from the ~aterial world into the world of intuition. Identifying man with God seemed like heresy to some of the clergy. Others thought it was mere rhapsody or wishful thinking. And, of course, nlany .aardheaded men did not know what he was talking about. But the effect of this belief on Emerson was transcendent. To believe himself part of universal wisdom gave him a wonderful sense of freedom. It was the ultimate liberation. It was creative. Life seemed good fundamentally; nature and man could be trusted. Life was something not to be learned but to be lived. Now was the appointed hour for makin~ a fresh start. The doctrine was a receptive one. Better an imperfect theory, with glimpses of the truth, than digested systems that were dead. Emerson's faith was dynamic. And that was why he seemed to the young people of his time to be the great cultural liberator. He was always on the side of imaginative exploration. In \"The American Scholar\" he said the sole use of books is to !nspire: .... INTRODUCTION \u2022 \u2022\u2022 XX111 ;'One must be a creator to read well.\" The scholar's preoccupation wi'(h bookish learning seemed moribund to him. He urged the scholar to become a ma.n of action and learn directly from life: \"Life is our dictionary. Years are well spent in country labors; in town; in the insight into trades and manufactures; in frank in- tercourse with many men and women; in science; !;'l art; to the end of mastering in all facts a language by which to illustrate and embody our perceptions.\" He enkindled the hearts of the young', divinity students ?lith the same criticism of institutions and the same invitation to life. Religion should have a corrJ.mOll accent away from the cloister: \"The time is coming", "of mastering in all facts a language by which to illustrate and embody our perceptions.\" He enkindled the hearts of the young', divinity students ?lith the same criticism of institutions and the same invitation to life. Religion should have a corrJ.mOll accent away from the cloister: \"The time is coming when all men will see that the gift of God to the soul is not a vaunting, overpower- ing, excluding sanctity, but a sweet, natural goodness, a goodness like thine and mine, and that so invites thine and mine to be and to grow.\" He complained that religion was treated in the pulpit \"as if God were dead.\" If \"The Over-Soul\" is the cornerstone of Emerson's philosophy, the essay on \"Self-Reliance\" is his most ringing declaration .\"i its meaning. Some of his essays are inconclusive and many of them are disorderly; not every subject pulled all his random reflections together. But in \"Self-Reliance\" he courageously ex- horts his readers to act on their best impulses and to make no compromise with duty. ('To believe your own thought,\" he says, \"to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men-is genius.\" It is natural for a man to behave with a certain nonchalance and disdain, he says. No lip-service to cus- tom, he says; no weak philanthropy; no good action to appease popular conscience; no political affiliations; no terrified adher- ence to consistency. Society urges caution; social usages restrict freedom of action; conformity is convenient. But according to Emerson, \"N otbing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.\" Although he was a mild man personally, there is a pas .. sionate summons to independence in this paper. \"Let a man then know his worth,\" he says, \"and keep things under", "convenient. But according to Emerson, \"N otbing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.\" Although he was a mild man personally, there is a pas .. sionate summons to independence in this paper. \"Let a man then know his worth,\" he says, \"and keep things under his feet .. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper in the world which exist3 \u2022 XXIV INTRODUCTION for him.\" Have no regrets. Never imitate. \"Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but !he triumph of principles,\" he concluded. Years afterward a RussIan student was exiled to Siberia for having a copy of Emerson's l\u00b7Self-Reliance\" in his possession. Some people criticized Emerson for being ingenuous. He seized people \"by their best handles,\" they said, and too easily believed the best of them. '~\\lhen his imagination went to work on the rail~ road or the electric. telegraph, which were new to his day, he foresaw a glorious future for them. When he considered the po- tentialities of the country, his hopes were-again-transcendent. \"Gentlemen,\" he said to the Mercantile Library Association in Boston, \"there is a sublime and friendly destiny by which the hu..\"nan race is guided.\" Would he think so in the twentieth cen- tury? It is a speculative question, but the answer is easy. The answer is \"Yes.\" For his contemplative affirmations, which suited the mood of America in his day, proceeded from his temperament. Habitually looking beyond particulars to the fundamental truths of nature and mankind he believed that \"creation is here and now,\" as Thoreau expressed it. There were reasons enough for despair in his day. Politics were corrupt.l\\tIaterialism possessed the hearts and souls of men. The country", "day, proceeded from his temperament. Habitually looking beyond particulars to the fundamental truths of nature and mankind he believed that \"creation is here and now,\" as Thoreau expressed it. There were reasons enough for despair in his day. Politics were corrupt.l\\tIaterialism possessed the hearts and souls of men. The country was still betraying the Indians. The Mexican War vio- lated every just man's notions of decency. One of Emerson's idols, Daniel Webster, turned traitor to one of Emerson's causes. The great tragedy of the Civil War, when citizens of the same country killed one another, cut straight across Emerson '5 career. And the appalling pillag~ of the South after the war by oppor- tunistic politicians and beady-eyed swindlers represented the low point in our national ethics. Ignorance and evil drew a black line through the life of America in Emerson's time and many of his contemporaries 'Yere filled with melancholy. He knew those things and suffered for them. After reading the newspapers he often walked to his Walden woods to restore his mind again and reorient himself in the universe. But nothing could shake his faith in the goodness of the universe. For he was ~nspired .... ~ he traveled around the country with his worn lec ... INTRODUCTION xxv ture bag and looked into the faces of Americans he could not help believing. Gentle, kindly and upright, he was the teacher of America. What he said and wrote is still the gospel we most easily understand.

INTRODUCTION OUR age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes biographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing gen- erations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe? Why should not vve have a poetry and philosophy of in sight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of life stream around and through us, and invite us, by the po\\vers they supply, to action proportioned to nature, Why should we grope an10ng the dry bones of the past, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe? The sun shines to-day also. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are new lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and worship.

There are new lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and worship. Undoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswer- able. We n1ust trust the perfection of the creation so far as to be- lieve that whatever curiosity the order of things has awakened in our Ininds, the order of things can satisfy. Every man's condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries be would put. He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth. In like manner, nature is already, in its forrns and tendencies, describing its own d.esign. Let us interrogate the great apparition that shines so peacefully around us. Let us inquire, to what end is nature? All science has one aim, na111ely, to find a theory of nature. We have theories of races and of functions, but scarcely yet a remote approach to an idea of creation. We are novY so far from the road to truth, that religious teachers dispute and hate each other, and speculative l11en are esteen1ed unsound and frivolous. But to a sound judgn1ent, the most abstract truth is the most practical.. Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is, that it will explain all phenomena. Now many are thought :~ 4 NATURE not only unexplained but inexplicable; as language, sleep, mad ... ness, dreams, beasts, sex. Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul. Strictly speaking, therefore, all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men and my own body, must be ranked under this name, NATURE.

Strictly speaking, therefore, all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy distinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men and my own body, must be ranked under this name, NATURE. In enumerating the values of nature and casting up their sum, I shall use the word in both senses-in its common and in its philosophical import. In in- quiries so general as our present one, the inaccuracy is not mate- rial; no confusion of thought will occur. Nature, in the common sense, refers to essences uncbanged by man; space, the air, the river, the leaL Art is applied to the mixture of his will with the same things, as in a house, a canal, a statue, a picture. But hi.q operations taken together are so insignificant, a little chipping, baking, patching, and washing, that in an impression so grand as that of the world on the human mind, they do not vary the result. NATURE I To GO into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his cham l ber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sub ... lime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men be- lieve and adore; and preserve for many generations the remem\u00b7 brance of the city of God which", "the perpetual presence of the sub ... lime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men be- lieve and adore; and preserve for many generations the remem\u00b7 brance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile. The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present~ they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a kin- dred impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man ex- tort. her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out aU her perfec- tion. Nature never became a toy to a wise spirit. The flowers, the animals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had delighted the simplicity of his childhood. When we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct bu1 most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impres\u00b7 sion made by manifold natural objects. It is this which distin- guishes the stick of timber of the wood-cutter from the tree of the poet. The charming landscape which I saw this n10rning is indu- bitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this , field, Locke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the landscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye can integrate all the parts, 5 6 NATURE that IS, the poet. This is the best part of these men's farms, yet tu this their warranty-deeds give no title.

This is the best part of these men's farms, yet tu this their warranty-deeds give no title. To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature.l\\iost persons do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the t;ye and the heart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; 'who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of man- hood. His intercourse with heaven and earth becomes part of his daily food. In the presence of nature a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says-he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight; for every hour and change corre- sponds to and authorizes a different state of the mind, fronl breathless noon to grimmest midnight. Nature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning piece. In good health, the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have en .. joyed a perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods, too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life is always a child. In the woods is per~tnaI youth.

Within these plantations of God, a decoruln and oanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can be .. fall me in life-no disgrace, no calamity (leaving me my eyes), which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground-my b~ad bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space-all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball\" I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being ci~cu]a.te through me; I am part or parcel of God.

I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wUuerness I find something more dear and connate\u00b7 than ill N ATU RE 7 streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature. The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that", "occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the storm is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right. Yet it is certain that the power to produce this delight does not reside in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For nature is not always tricked in holiday attire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for the frolic of the nymphs is overspread with melancholy to-day .. Nature always wears the colors of the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of his own fire hath sadness in it. Then there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population. II COMMODITY WHOEVER considers the final cause of the world will discern a multitude of uses that enter as parts into that result. They all admit of being thrown into one of the following classes: Com- modity; Beauty; Language; and Discipline. Under the general name of commodity, I rank all those advan- tages which our senses owe to nature. This, of course, is a benefit which is temporary and mediate, not ultimate, like its service to the soul. Yet although low, it is perfect in its kind, and is the only use of nature which all men apprehend. The misery of", "advan- tages which our senses owe to nature.

Yet although low, it is perfect in its kind, and is the only use of nature which all men apprehend. The misery of man ap .. pears like childish petulance, when we explore the steady and prodigal provision that has been made for his support and delight on this green ball which floats him through the heavens. What 8 NATURE angels invented these splendid ornaments, these rich conven- iences, this ocean of air above, this ocean of water beneath, this firmament of earth between? this zodiac of lights, this tent of dropping clouds, this striped coat of climates, this fourfold year? Beasts, fire, water, stones, and corn serve him. The field is at once his fioor, his work-yard, his play-ground, his garden, and his bed. \"More servants wait on man Than he'll take notice of.\" Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the process and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other's hands for the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the wind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet, condenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal; and thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man. The useful arts are reproductions or new combinations by the wit of man, of the same natural benefactors. He no longer waits for favoring gales, but by means of steam, he realizes the fable of Aeolus's bag, and carries the two and thirty winds in the boiler of his boat.

He no longer waits for favoring gales, but by means of steam, he realizes the fable of Aeolus's bag, and carries the two and thirty winds in the boiler of his boat. To diminish friction, he paves the road with iron bars, and, mounting a coach with a ship-load of men, animals, and merchandise behind him, he darts through the country, from town to town, like an eagle or a swallow through the air. By the aggregate of these aids, how is the face of the world changed, from the era of N oab to that of Napoleon! The private poor man hath cities, ships, canals, bridges, built for him. He goes to the post ... office, and the human race run on his errands; to the book-shop, and the human race read and write of all that happens for him; to the court-house, and nations repair his wrongs. He sets his house upon the road, and the human race go forth every morning, and shovel out the snow, and cut a path for him. But there is no need of specifying particulars in this class of uses. The catalogue is endless, and the examples so obvious, that I shall leave t~em to the reader's reflection, with the general remark, that thIS mercenary benefit is one which has respect to a NATURE 9 farther good. A man is fed, not that he may be fed, but that he may work. III BEAUTY A NOBLER want of man is served by nature, namely, the love of Beauty.

III BEAUTY A NOBLER want of man is served by nature, namely, the love of Beauty. The ancient Greeks called the world KOOl-l0;', beauty_ Such is the constitution of all things, or such the plastic power of the human eye, that the primary forms, as the sky, the mountain, the tree, the animal, give us a delight in and for themselves; a pleasure arising from outline, color, motion, and grouping. This seems partly owing to the eye itself. The eye is the best of artists. By the mutual action of its structure and of the laws of light, perspective is produced, which integrates every mass of objects, of what character soever, into a well colored and shaded globe, so that where the particular objects are mean and unaffecting, the landscape which they compose is round and symmetricaL And as the eye is the best composer, so light is the first of painters. There is no object so foul that intense light will not make beautiful. And the stimulus it affords to the sense, and a sort of infinitude which it hath, like space and time, make all matter gay. Even the corpsI:' has its own beauty. But besides this general grace diffused over nature, almost all the individual forms are agreeable to the eye, as is proved by our endless imitations of sonle of them, as the acorn, the grape, the pine-cone, the wheat-ear, the egg, the wings' and forms of most birds, the lion's claw, the serpent, the butter- fly, sea-shells, flames, clouds, buds, leaves, and the forms of many trees, as the palm. For better consideration, we may distribute the aspects of Beauty in a threefold manner. I. First, the simple perception of natural forms is a delight.

The influence of the forms and actions in nature is so needful to man, that, in its lowest functions, it seems to lie on the confines {)f commodity and beauty .. To the body and mind which have been cramped by noxious work or como any , nature is medicinal IO NATURE and restores their tone. The tradesman, the attorney comes out of the din and craft of the street and sees the sky and the woods, ~nd is a man again. In their eternal calm, he finds himself. The 'Jealth of the eye seems to demand a horizon. We are never tired, so long as we can see far enough. But in other hours, Nature satisfies by its loveliness, and with- out any mixture of corporeal benefit. I see the spectacle of morn .... ing from the hilltop over against my house, from daybreak to sun- rise, with emotions which an angel might share. The long slender bars of claud float like fishes in the sea of crimson light. From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid transformations; the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind. How does .Nature deify us with a few and cheap elements! Give me health and a day, and I will make the pomp of emperors ricliculous.

The dawn\"is my Assyria; the sunset and moonrise my Paphos, and unimaginable realms of faerie; broad noon shall be my England of the senses and the understanding; the night shall be my Ger- many of mystic philosophy and dreams. Not less excellent, except for our less susceptibility in the after- noon, was the charm, last evening, of a January sunset The western clouds divided and subdivided themselves into pink flakes modulated with tints of unspeakable softness, and the air bad so much life and sweetness that it was a pain to come within doors. What was it that nature would say? Was there no meaning in the live repose of the valley behind the mill, and which Homer or Shakspeare could not re-form for me in words? The leafless trees become spires of flame in the sunset, with the blue east for their background, and the stars of the dead calices of flowers,. and every withered stem and stubble rimed with frost, contribute something to the mute music. The inhabitants of cities suppose that the country landscape is. pleasant only half the year. I please myself with the graces of the winter scenery, and believe that we are as much touched by it as by the genial influences of summer. To the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the same field it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before ~nd, NATURE which shall never be seen again. The heavens change every mo- ment, and reflect their glory or gloom on the plains beneath.

The heavens change every mo- ment, and reflect their glory or gloom on the plains beneath. The state of the crop in the surrounding farms alters the expression of the earth from week to week. The succession of native plants in the pastures and roadsides, which make the silent clock by which time tells the summer hours, will make even the divisions of the day sensible to a keen observer. The tribes of birds and insects, like the plants punctual to their time, follow each other, and the year has room for all. By watercourses, the variety is greater. In July, the blue pontederia or pickerel-weed blooms in large beds in the shallow parts of our pleasant river, and swarms with yellow butterflies in continual motion. Art can- not rival this pomp of purple and gold. Indeed the river is a per- petual gala, and boasts each month a new ornament. But this beauty of Nature which is seen and felt as beauty, is. the least part. The shows of day, the dewy morning, the rainbow, mountains, orchards in blossom, stars, moonlight, shadows in still water, and the like, if too eagerly hunted, become shows merely, and mock us with their unreality. Go out of the house to see the moon, and 't is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its light shines upon your necessary journey. The beauty that shimmers in the yellow afternoons of October, who ever could clutch it? Go forth to find it, and it is gone; 't is only a mirage as you look from the windows of diligence. 2.

Go forth to find it, and it is gone; 't is only a mirage as you look from the windows of diligence. 2. The presence of a higher, namely, of the spiritual element is essential to its perfection. The high and divine beauty which can be loved without efienlinacy, is that which is found in com- bination with the human will. Beauty is the mark God sets upon virtue. Every natural action is graceful Every heroic\u00b7 acfis also '(Iecent, and causes the place and the bystanders to shine. We are taught by great B:ctions that the universe is the property of every individual in it. Every rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his, if he wilL He may divest himself of it; he\"may creep into a corner, and abdicate his kingdom, as most men do, but he is entitled to the world by his constitution. In pro .. portion to the energy of his thought and will, he takes up the world into himself. \",All those things for which men plo~gh, build, 12 NATURE or sail obey virtue\"\" said Sallust. \"The winds and waves,\" said Gilibo~, \"are alwa.;s on the side of the ablest navigators.\" So are the sun and moon and all the stars of heaven. When a noble act is done-perchance in a scene of great natural beauty; when Leonidas and his three hundred martyrs consume one day in dy- ing and the sun and moon come each and look at them once in the'steep defile of Thermopylae; when Arnold Winkelried, in the high Alps, under the shadow of the avalanche, gathers in his side a sheaf of Austrian spears to break the line for", "consume one day in dy- ing and the sun and moon come each and look at them once in the'steep defile of Thermopylae; when Arnold Winkelried, in the high Alps, under the shadow of the avalanche, gathers in his side a sheaf of Austrian spears to break the line for his comrades; are not these heroes entitled to add the beauty of the scene to the beauty of the deed? When the bark of Columbus nears the shore of America; before it the beach lined with savages, fleeing out of all their huts of cane; the sea behind; and the purple mountains of the Indian Archipelago around, can we separate the man from the living picture? Does not the New World clothe his form with her palm-groves and savannahs as fit drapery? Ever does natural beauty steal in like air, and envelop great actions. When Sir Harry Vane was dragged up the Tower-hill, sitting on a sled, to suffer death as the champion of the English laws, one of the mul- titude cried out to him, \"You never sate on so glorious a seat!\" Charles II, to intimidate the citizens of London, caused the patriot Lord Russell to be drawn in an open coach through the principal streets of the city on his way to the scaffold. \"But,\" his biographer says, \"the multitude imagined they saw liberty and virtue sitting by his side.\" In private places, alnong sordid ob- jects, an act of truth or heroism seems at once to draw to itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its candle. Nature stretches out her arms to embrace man, only ~~.t his thoughts'oe of equal great- ness.

Nature stretches out her arms to embrace man, only ~~.t his thoughts'oe of equal great- ness. Willingly does she-follow his steps with the rose and the violet, and bend her lines of grandeur and grace to the decoration of her darling child. Only let his thoughts be of equal scope, and the frame will suit the picture. A virtuous man is in unison with her works, and makes the central figure of the visible sphere. Homer, Pindar, Socrates, Phocion, associate themselves fitly in {)ur memory with the geography and climate of Greece. The vis ... ible heavens and earth sympathize with Jesus. And in common life whosoey,er has seen a person of powerful character and happy NATURE I3 genius, will have remarked how easily he took all things along with him-the persons, the opinions, and the day, and nature became ancillary to a man. 3. There is still another aspect under which the beauty of the world may be viewed, namely, as it becomes an object of the intellec.t. Beside the relation of things to virtue, they have a rela- tion to thought. The intellect searches out the absolute order of things as they stand in the mind of God, and without the colors of affection. The intellectual and the active powers seem to suc- ceed each other, and the exclusive activity of the one generates the exclusive activity of the other. There is something unfriendly in each to the other, but they are like the alternate periods of feeding and working in animals; each prepares and will be fol- lowed by the other. Therefore does beauty, which, in relation to actions, as we have seen, comes unsought, and comes because it is unsought, remain for the", "each to the other, but they are like the alternate periods of feeding and working in animals; each prepares and will be fol- lowed by the other. Therefore does beauty, which, in relation to actions, as we have seen, comes unsought, and comes because it is unsought, remain for the apprehension and pursuit of the in .. tellect; and then again, in its turn, of the active power. Nothing divine dies. All good is eternally reproductive. The beauty of nature re-forms itself in the mind, and not for barren contempla ... tion, but for new creation. All men are in some degree impressed by the face of the world; some men even to delight. This love of beauty is Taste. Others have the same love in such excess, that, not content with admir- ing, they seek to embody it in new forms. The creation of beauty is Art .. The production of a work of art throws a light upon the mystery of humanity\" A work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world. It is the result or expression of nature, in miniature. For although the works of nature are innumerable and all differ- en t, the result or the expression of them all is similar and single. Nature is a sea of forms radically alike and even unique. A leaf, a sunbeam, a landscape, the ocean, make an analogous impression on the mind. What is common to them all-that perfectness and harmony, is beauty. The standard of beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms-the totality of nature; which the Italians ex- pressed by defining beauty ceil pili nell' uno.\" N otbing is quite beautiful alone; nothing but is beautiful in tbe whole. A single 14 NATURE object is only so far beautiful as it suggests", "of beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms-the totality of nature; which the Italians ex- pressed by defining beauty ceil pili nell' uno.\" N otbing is quite beautiful alone; nothing but is beautiful in tbe whole. A single 14 NATURE object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace. The poet, the painter, the sculptor, the musician, the architect, seek each to concentrate this radiance of the world on one point, and each in his several work to satisfy the love of beauty '~Thich stimulates him to produce. Thus is Art a nature passed through the alembic of man. Thus in art does Nature work through the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first works. The world thus exists to the soul to satisfy the desire of beauty. This element I call an ultimate end. No reason can be asked or given why the soul seeks beauty. Beauty, in its largest and pro- foundest sense, is one expression for the universe. God is the all .. fair. Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are but different faces of the same AlL But beauty in nature is not ultimate. It is the herald of inward and eternal beauty, and is not alone a solid and satis .. factory good. It must stand as a part, and not as yet the last or highest expression I.Jf the final cause of Nature. IV LANGUAGE LANGUAGE is a third use which Nature subserves to man. Nature is the vehicle of thought, and in a simple, double, and three-fold degree. I. Words are signs of natural facts. 2. Particular natural facts are symbols of particular spiritual ' facts. 3. Nature is the symbol of spirit. I. Words are signs of natural facts. The use of natural his- tory", "the vehicle of thought, and in a simple, double, and three-fold degree. I.

The use of natural his- tory is to give us aid in superna.tural history; the use of the outer creation, to give us language for the beings and changes of the inward creation. Every word which is used to express a moral or intellectual fact, if tra.ced to its root, is found to be borro\",' ed from some material appearance. Right means straight; wrong means twisted; Spirit primarily means wind; transgression, the crossing of a lim; supercilious, the raising of the e'yebrow. We say the heart to expre~s emotion, the ltead to denote thought; and ~ho1J,ght and emotzon are words borrowed from sensible things NATURE IS and now appropriated to spiritual nature.l\\Iost of the process by which this transformation is made, is hidden from us in the re- mote time when language was framed; but the same tendency may be daily observed in children. Children and savages use only nouns or names of things, which they convert into verbs, and apply to analogous mental acts. 2. But this origin of all words that convey a spiritual import -so r,onspicuous a fact in the history of language-is our least debt to nature. It is not words only that are emblematic; it is things which are emblematic. Every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact. Every appea:ance in nature corresponds to some state of the mind, and that state of the mind can only be described by presenting that natural appearance as its picture. An enraged man is a lion, a cunning man is a fox,", "natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact. Every appea:ance in nature corresponds to some state of the mind, and that state of the mind can only be described by presenting that natural appearance as its picture. An enraged man is a lion, a cunning man is a fox, a firm man is a rock, a learned man is a torch. A lamb is innocence; a snake is subtle spite; flowers express to us the delicate affections. Light and darkness are our familiar expression for knowledge and igno- rance; and beat for love. Visible distance behind and before us, is respectively our image of memory and hope. \\Vho looks upon a river in a meditative hour and is not re- minded of the flux of all things? Throw a stone into the stream!t and the circles that propagate themselves are the beautiful type of all influence. Man is conscious of a universal soul within or behind his individual life, wherein, as in a firmament, the natures of Justice, Truth, Love, Freedom, arise and shine. This universal soul he calls Reason: it is not mine, or t bine, or bis, but we ~L\\e its; we are its property and men. And the blue sky in which c~n.e p~i\u00ad vate earth is buried, the sky with its eternal calm, and full of everlasting orbs, is the type of Reason. That which intellectl),'.tlly considered we call Reason, considered in relation to nature, we call Spirit. Spirit is the Creator. Spirit hath life in itself.

AIJd man in all ages and countries embodies it in his language as the ' FATHER. It is easily seen that there is nothing lucky or capricious in these analogies, but that they are constant, and pervade nature. These are not the dreams of a few poets, here and there, but lnan is an ana.1ogist, and studies relations in all objects. He is placed 16 NATURE in the centre of beings, and a ray of relation passes from ever) other being to him. And neither can man be understood without these objects, nor these objects without man. All the facts in natural history taken by themselves, have no value, but are bar .. ren, like a single sex. But marry it to human history, and it is full of life. \"'llole floras, all Linnreus' and Buffon's volumes, are dry catalogues of facts; but the most trivial of these facts, the habit .of a plant, the organs, or work, or noise of an insect, applied to the illustration of a fact in intellectual philosophy, or in any way associated to human nature, affects us in the n10st lively and agreeable manner. The seed of a plant-to what affecting analo .. gies in the nature of man is that little fruit made use of, in all dis~ course, up to the voice of Paul, who calls the human corpse a seed -\"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" The motion of the earth round its axis and round the sun, makes the day and the year.

The instincts of the ant are very unimportant con .. sidered as the ant's; but the moment a ray of relation is seen to e.~tend from it to man, and the little drudge is seen to be a Inoni- tor, a little body with a mighty heart, then all its habits, even that said to be recently observed, that it never sleeps, become sublinle. Because of this radical correspondence between visible things and human thoughts, savages, who have only what is necessary, converse in figures. As we go back in history, language beC0111eS more picturesque, until its infancy, when it is all poetry; or all spiritual facts are represented by natural symbols. The sanle symbols are found to make the original elements of all languages. It has moreover been observed, that the idioms of all languages approach each other in passages of the greatest eloquence and power .. And as this is the first language, so is it the last. This im- mediate dependence of language upon nature, this cOllversion of an outward phenomenon into a type of somewhat in human life never loses its power to affect us. It is this which gives that piquancy to the conversation of a strong-natured farmer or back- woodsman, which all men relish. NATURE A man's power to connect his thought with its proper sytnbol, and so to utter it, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon his love of truth and his desire to communicate it without loss.

NATURE A man's power to connect his thought with its proper sytnbol, and so to utter it, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon his love of truth and his desire to communicate it without loss. The corruption of man is followed by the corruption of lan- guage. When simplicity of ch~racter and the sovereignty of ideas is broken up by the prevalence of secondary desires-the desire of riches, of pleasure, of power, and of praise-and duplicity and falsehood take place of simplicity and truth, the power over nature as an interpreter of the will is in a degree lost; new im- agery ceases to be created, and old words are perverted to stand for things which are not; a paper currency is employed, when there is no bullion in the vaults. In due time the fraud i$ manifest, and words lose all power to stimulate the understanding or the affections. Hundreds of writers may be found in every long-civil- ized nation who for a short time believe and make others believe that they see and utter truths, who do not of themselves clothe one thought in its natural garment, but who feed unconsciously on the language created by the primary writers of the country, those, namely, who hold primarily on nature. But wise men pierce this rotten diction and fasten words again to visible things; so that picturesque language is at once a com .. manding certificate that he who employs it is a man in alliance with truth and God. The moment our discourse rises above the ground line of familiar facts and is inflamed with passion or ex- alted by thought, it clothes itself in images.

The moment our discourse rises above the ground line of familiar facts and is inflamed with passion or ex- alted by thought, it clothes itself in images. A man conversing in earnest, if he watch his intellectual processes, will find that a ma- terial image more or less luminous arises in his mind, contem- poraneous with every thought, which fq.rnishes the vestment of the thought. Hence, good writing and brilliant discourse are per- petual allegories. This imagery is spontaneous. It is the blending of experience with the present action of the mind. It is proper creation. It is the working of the Original Cause through the in- struments he has already made. These facts may suggest the advantage which the country-life possesses, for a powerful mind, over the artificial and curtailed life of cities. We know more from nature than we can at will communicate. Its light flows into the mind evermore, and we for- 18 NATURE get its presence. T~le poet, the orator, bred in the woods, whose senses have been nourished by their fair and appeasing changes, year after year, without design and without heed-shall not lose their lesson altogether, in the roar of cities or the broil of politics. Long hereafter, amidst agitation and terror in national councils -in the hour of revolution-these solemn images shall reappear in their morning lustre, as fit symbols and words of the thoughts which the passing events shall awaken. At the call of a noble sentiment, again the woods wave, the pines murmur, the river rolls and shines, and the cattle low upon the mountains, as he saw and heard them in his infancy.

And with these forms, the spells of persuasion, the keys of power are put into his hands. 3. We are thus assisted by natural objects in the expression of partiCUlar meanings. But how great a language to convey such pepper-corn informations! Did it need such noble races of crea- tures, this profusion of forms, this host of orbs in heaven, to fur- nish man with the dictionary and grammar of his municipal speech? Whilst we use this grand cipher to expedite the affairs of our pot and kettle, we feel that we have not yet put it to its use, neither are able. 'Ve are like travellers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs. Whilst we see that it always stnnds ready to clothe '\\\\t~hat we would say, we cannot avoid the question whether the characters are not significant of themselves. Have mountains, and waves, and skies, no significance but what we consciously give them when we employ them as -emblems of our thoughts? The world is emblematic. Parts of speech are meta- phors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the human nlind. The laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face to face in a glass. \"The visible world and the relation of its parts, is the dial plate of the invisible.\" The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics. Thus, \"the whole is greater than its part\u00b7\" \"reaction is equal to action;\" \"the smallest weight may be made to lift the greatest, the difference of weight being compensated by time;\" and many the", "is the dial plate of the invisible.\" The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics. Thus, \"the whole is greater than its part\u00b7\" \"reaction is equal to action;\" \"the smallest weight may be made to lift the greatest, the difference of weight being compensated by time;\" and many the like propositions, which have an ethical as well as physical sense. These propositions have a much more ex- tensive and universal sense when applied to human life than when confined to technical use. ' NATURE 19 In like manner, the memorable words of history and the prov- erbs of nations consist usually of a natural fact, selected as a pic ... ture or parable of a moral truth. Thus: A rolling stone gathers no moss; A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; A cripple in the right way will beat a racer in the wrong; l\\Iake hay while the sun shines; 'T is hard to carry a full cup even; Vinegar is the son of wine; The last ounce broke the camel's back; Long-lived trees make roots first-and the like. In their primary sense these are trivial facts, but we repeat them for the value of +.heir ana- logical import. What is true of proverbs, is true of all faoles, par- ables, and allegories. This relation between the mind and matter is not fancied by some poet, but stands in the will of God, and so is free to be known by all men. It appears to men, or it does not appear. When in fortunate hours we ponder this miracle, the wise mall doubts if at all other times he is not blind and deaf; \"Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without our special wonder?\" for the universe becomes transparent,", "to men, or it does not appear. When in fortunate hours we ponder this miracle, the wise mall doubts if at all other times he is not blind and deaf; \"Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer's cloud, Without our special wonder?\" for the universe becomes transparent, and the light of higher laws than its own shines through it. It is the standing problem which has exercised the wonder and the study of every fine genius since the world began; from. the era of the Egyptians and the Brahmins to that of Pythagoras, of Plato, of Bacon, of Leibnitz} of Swedenborg. There sits the Sphinx at the road ... side, and from age to age, as each prophet comes by, he tries his fortune at reading her riddle. There seems to be a necessity in spirit to mani 4 ' fest itself in material forms; and day and night, river and storm, beast and bird, acid and alkali, preexist in necessary Ideas in the mind of God, and are what they are by virtue of preceding affec- tions in the world of spirit. A Fact is the end or last issue of spirit. The visible creation is the terminus or the circumference of tbe invisible world, \"Material objects,\" said a French philosopber, ('are necessarily kinds of scoric:e of the substantial thoughts of the Creator, which must always preserve an exact relation to their 20 NATURE first origin; in other words, visible nature must have a spiritual and moral side.\" This doctrine is abstruse, and though the images of \"garment,\" \"scorire,\" \"mirror,\" etc., may stimulate the fancy, we must sum- mon the aid of subtler and more vital expositors to make it plain. \"Every scripture is to be interpreted by the same spirit which gave it forth,\" is", "moral side.\" This doctrine is abstruse, and though the images of \"garment,\" \"scorire,\" \"mirror,\" etc., may stimulate the fancy, we must sum- mon the aid of subtler and more vital expositors to make it plain. \"Every scripture is to be interpreted by the same spirit which gave it forth,\" is the fundamental law of criticism. A life in har\u00b7 many with Nature, the love of truth and of virtue, will purge the eyes to understand her text. By degrees we may come to know the primitive sense of the permanent objects of nature, so that the world shall be to us an open book, and every form significant of its hidden life and final cause. A new interest surprises us, whilst, under the view now sug- gested, we contemplate the fearful extent and multitude of ob .. jects; since \"every object rightly seen, unlocks a new faculty of the souL\" That which was unconscious truth, becomes, when in- terpreted and defined in an object, a part of the domain of knowl .. edge-a new weapon in the magazine of power. v DISCIPLINE IN VIEW of the significance of nature, we arrive at once at a new fact, that nature is a discipline. This use of the world includes the preceding uses, as parts of itself. Space, time, society, labor, climate, food, locomotion, the ani- mals, the mechanical forces, give us sincerest lessons, day by day, Whose mealling is unlimited. They educate both the Understand ... ing and the Reason. Every property of matter is a school for the underst~TI.ding-its solidity or resistance, its inertia, its extension, its figure, its divisibility. The understanding adds, divides, com- bines, measures, and finds nutriment and room for its activity in this worthy scene. l\\Ieantime, Reason transfers all these lessons into its own world of", "property of matter is a school for the underst~TI.ding-its solidity or resistance, its inertia, its extension, its figure, its divisibility. The understanding adds, divides, com- bines, measures, and finds nutriment and room for its activity in this worthy scene. l\\Ieantime, Reason transfers all these lessons into its own world of thought, by perceiving the analogy that marries 1\\:Iatter and l\\iind. I. Nature is a discipline of the understanding in intellectual truths. Our dealing with sensible objects is a constant exercise in NATURE 21 the necessary lessons of difference, of likeness, of order, of being and seeming, of progressive arrangement; of ascent from particu- lar to general; of combination to one end of manifold forces. Proportioned to the importance of the organ to be formed, is the extreme care with which its tuition is provided-a care preter ... , mitted in no single case. What tedious training, day after day, year after year never ending, to form the common sense; what continual repfoduction of annoyances, inconveniences, dilem- mas; what r~joicing over us of little men; what disputing of prices, whatJ~eckonings of interest-and all to form the Hand of the mind-Jo instruct us that\" good thoughts are no better than good dream~, unless they be executed! \" The same good office is performed by Property and its filiai systems of debt and credit. Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow, the orphan, and the sons of genius fear and hate- debt, which consumes so much time, which so cripples and dis- heartens a great spirit with cares that seem so base, is a preceptor whose lessons cannot be foregone, and is needed most by those who suffer from it most.

Moreover, property, which has been well compared to snow-\"if it fall level to-day, it will be blown into drifts to ... morrow,\" is the surface action of internal machin- ery, like the index on the face of a clock. Whilst now it is the gymnastics of the understanding, it is hiving, in the foresight of the spirit, experience in profounder laws. The whole character and fortune of the individual are affected by the least inequalities in the culture of the understanding; for example, in the perception of differences. Therefore is Space, and therefore Tinle, that man may know that things are not huddled and lumped, but sundered and individual. A bell and a plough have each their use, and neither can do the office of the other. Water is good to drink, coal to burn, wool to wear; but wool can ... not be drunk, nor water spun, nor coal eaten. The wise man shows his wisdom in separation, in gradation, and his scale of creatures and of merits is as wide as nature. The foolish have no range in their scale, but suppose every man is as every other man. What is not good they call the worst, and what is not hateful, they call the best. 22 NATURE In like manner, what good heed Nature forms in us! She par .. dons no mistakes. Her yea is yea, and her nay, nay. The first steps in Agriculture, Astronomy, Zoology (those first steps which the farmer, the hunter, and the sailor take), teach that Nature's dice are always loaded; that in her heaps and rubbish are concealed sure and useful", "par .. dons no mistakes. Her yea is yea, and her nay, nay. The first steps in Agriculture, Astronomy, Zoology (those first steps which the farmer, the hunter, and the sailor take), teach that Nature's dice are always loaded; that in her heaps and rubbish are concealed sure and useful results. How calmly and genially the mind apprehends one after an .. other the laws of physics! What noble emotions dilate the mortal as he enters into the touncils of the creation, and feels by knowl- edge the privilege to BE! His insight refines him. The beauty of nature shines in his own breast. Man is greater that he can see this, and the universe less, because Time and Space relations va.n ... . ish as laws are known. Here again we are impressed and even daunted by the im ... mense Universe to be explored. \"What we know is a point to what we do not know.\" Open any recent journal of science, and weigh the problems suggested concerning Light, Heat, Electricity, IVlag- netism, Physiology, Geology, and judge whether the interest of natural science is likely to be soon exhausted. Passing by many particulars of the discipline of nature~ we mU$t not omit to specify two. , ... /'\u00b7'The exercise of the Will, or the lesson of power, is taught in every event. From the child's successive possession of his several , senses up to the bour when he saith, \"Thy will be done!\" he is learning the secret that he can reduce under his will not only par- ticular events but great classes, nay, the whole series of events, and so conform all facts to his character.

Nature is thoroughly mediate. It is made to serve. It receives the dominion of mall as meekly as the ass on which the Saviour rode. It offers all its king ... doms to Inan as the raw material which he may mould into what is useful. Man is never weary of working it up. He forges the subtile and delicate air into wise and melodious words and gives them wing as angels of persuasion and command. On~ after an ... oth~r his victorious thought comes up with and reduces all things, until the world becomes at last only a realized will-the double of the man. 2. Sensible objects conform to the vremonitions of Reason NATURE 23 and reflect the conscience. All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature. Therefore is nature glorious with form, color, and mo- tion; that every globe in the remotest heaven, every chemical change from the rudest crystal up to the laws of life, every change of vegetation from the first principle of growth in the eye of a leaf, to the tropical forest and antediluvian coal-mine, every ani- mal function from the sponge up to Hercules, shall hint or thun- der to man the laws of right and wrong, and echo the Ten Com- mandments. Therefore is Nature ever the ally of Religion: lends all her pomp and riches to the religious sentiment. Prophet and priest, David, Isaiah, Jesus, have drawn deeply from this source. This ethical character so penetrates the bone and marrow of nature, as to seem the end for which it was made.

This ethical character so penetrates the bone and marrow of nature, as to seem the end for which it was made. Whatever pri\u00b7 vate purpose is answered by any member or part, 'this is its pub ... lie and universal function, and is never omitted. Nothing in nature is exhausted in its first use. When a thing has served an end to the uttermost, it is wholly new for an ulterior service. In God, every end is converted into a new means. Thus the use of commodity, regarded by itself, is mean and squalid. But it is to the mind an education in the doctrine of Use, namely, that a thing is good only so far as it serves; that a conspiring of parts and efforts to the production of an end is essential to any being. The first and' gross manifestation of this truth is our inevitable and hated training in values and wants, in corn and meat. It has already been illustrated, that every natural process is a version of a moral sentence. The moral. law lies at the centre of . \" nature and radiates to the circumference. It is the pith and mar- \u2022 row of every substance, every relation, and every process~ All things with which we deal, preach to us. What is a farm but a mute gospel? The chaff and the wheat, weeds and plants, blight, rain, insects, sun-it is a sacred emblem from the first furrow of. spring to the last stack which the snow of winter overtakes in the fields.

But the sailor, the shepherd, the miner, the merchant, in their several resorts, have each an experience precisely parallel, and leading to the same conclusion: because all organizations are radically alike. Nor can it be doubted that this moral sentiment 24 NATURE which thus .scents the air, grows in the grain, and impregnates the waters of the world, is caught by man and sinks into his soul. The moral influence of nature upon every individual is that amount of truth which it illustrates to him. Who can estimate this? \\Vho can guess how much firmness the sea-beaten rock has taught the .fisherman? How much tranquillity has been reflected to man frOIn the azure sky, over whose unspotted deeps the winds forevermore drive flocks of stormy clouds, and leave no wrinkle or stain? How much industry and providence and affection we have caught from the pantomime of brutes? What a searching preacher of self-command is the varying phenomenon of Health! Herein is especially apprehended the unity of Nature-the unity in variety-which meets us everywhere. All the endless variety of things make an identical impression. Xenophanes COln- plained in his old age, that, look where he would, all things has .. tened back to Unity. He was weary of seeing the same entity in the tedious variety of forms. The fable of Proteus has a cordial truth .\u2022 \\ leaf, a drop, a crystal, a moment of time, is related to the whole} and partakes of the perfection of the whole.

Each particle is a Inicrocosm, and faithfully renders the likeness of the world. Not only resemblances exist in things whose analogy is obvi .. 0115, as when we detect the type of the human hand in the Hipper of the fossil saurus, but also in objects wherein there is great superficial unlikeness. Thus architecture is called \"frozen music,\" by De Stael and Goethe. Vitruvius thought an architect should be a musician. \"A Gothic church,\" said Coleridge, \"is a petrified religion.\" l\\fichael Angelo maintained, that, to an architect, a knowledge of anatomy is essential. In Haydn's oratorios, the notes present to the imagination not only motions, as of the snake, the stag, and the elephant, but colors also; as the green gr(1SS. The law of harmonic sounds reappears in the harmonic colors. The granite is differenced in its laws only by the more or less of heat from the river that wears it away. The river, as it flows, resembles the air that flows over it; the air resembles the light which traverses it with more subtile currents; the light re .. sembles the heat which rides with it through Space. Each creature i~ only a modification of the other; the likeness in them is more NATURE than the difference, and their radical law is one and the same.

A rule of one art, or a law of one organization, holds true through- out natur~. So intimate is this Unity, that, it is easily seen, it lies under the undermost garment of Nature, and betrays its source in Universal Spirit. For it pervades Thought also. Every uni .. versal truth which we express in words, implies or supposes every other truth. Omne verunz ve1\"O consonat. It is like l:. great circle on a sphere, comprising all possible circles; which, however, may be drawn and comprise it in like manner. Every such truth i&- the absolute Ens seen from one side. But it has innumerable sides .. The central Unity is still more conspicuous in actions. \\Vords ... are finite organs of the infinite mind. They cannot cover the \" dimensions of what is in truth. They break, chop, and impoverish it. An action is the perfection and publication of thought. A;:ight . action seems to fill the eye, and to be related to all nature. \"'The wise man, in doing one thing, does all; or, in the one thing be does rightly, he sees the likeness of all which is done rightly.\" Words and actions are not the attributes of brute nature. They' introduce us to the human form, of which all other organizations appear to be degradations. When this appears among so many that surround it, the spirit prefers it to all others. It says, \"From such as this have I drawn joy and knowledge; in such as this have I found and beheld myself; I will speak to it; it can speak again; it can yield me thought already formed and alive.\" In fact, the eye-the mind-is always accompanied by these forms, male and female; and these are incomparably the richest informations of the", "in such as this have I found and beheld myself; I will speak to it; it can speak again; it can yield me thought already formed and alive.\" In fact, the eye-the mind-is always accompanied by these forms, male and female; and these are incomparably the richest informations of the power and order that lie at the heart of things. Unfortunately everyone of them bears the marks as of some injury; is marred and superficially defective. Nevertheless, far different from the deaf and dumb nature around them, these all rest like fountain- pipes on the un fathomed sea of thought and virtue whereto they alone, of all organizations, are the entrances. It were a pleasant inquiry to follow into detail their ministry to our education, but where would it stop? We are associated in adolescent and adult life with some friends, who, like skies and waters, are coextensive with our idea; who, answering each to a certain affection of the soul) satisfy our desire on that side; whorr NATURE we lack power to put at such focal distance from us, that we can mend or even analyze them. \\Ve cannot choose but love them. When much intercourse with a friend has supplied ps with a standard of excellence, and has increased our respect for the resources of God who thus sends a real person to outgo our ideal; when he has, moreover, become an object of thought, and, whilst - his character retains all its unconscious effect, is converted in the mind into solid and sweet wisdom-it is a sign to us that his office is closing, and he is commonly withdrawn from our sight in a short time.

VI IDEALISM 'rHUS is the unspeakable but intelligible and practicable meaning of the world conveyed to man, the immortal pupil, in every object of sense. To this one end of Discipline, all parts of nature con- \u2022 SpIre. A noble doubt perpetually suggests itself-whether this end be not the Final Cause of the Universe; and whether nature out .. wardly exists. It is a sufficient account of that Appearance we call the \\Vorld, that God will teach a human mind, and so makes it the receiver of a certain number of congruent sensations, which we call sun and moon, man and woman, house and trade. In my utter impotence to test the authenticity of the report of my senses, to know whether the impressions they make on me corre- spond with outlying objects, what difference does it make, whether Orion is up there in heaven, or some god paints the im- age in the firmament of the soul? The relations of parts and the end of the whole remaining the same, what is the difference, whether land and sea interact, and worlds revolve and inter- mingle without number or end-deep yawning under deep and gala.~ balancing galaxy, throughout absolute space-or wh~thel\" without relations of time and space, the same appearances are in~ scribed i~ the constant faith of man?

Be it what it NATURE may, it is ideal to me so long as I canot try the accuracy of my senses. The frivolous make themselves merry with the Ideal theory, as if its consequences were burlesque; as i.f it affected the stabil- ity of nature. It surely does not. God never jests with us, and will not compromise the end of nature by permitting any inconse- quence in its procession. Any distrust of the permanence of laws would paralyze the faculties of man. 'fheir permanence is sacredly respected, and his faith therein is perfect. The wheels and springs of man are all set to the hypothesis of the permanence of nature. We are not built like a ship to be tossed, but like a bouse to stand. It is a natural consequence of this structure, that so long as the active powers predonlinate over the reflective, we resist with indignation any hint that nature is more short-lived or mutable than spirit. The broker, the wheelwright, the car .. penter, the tollman, are much displeased at the intimation. But whilst we acquiesce entirely in the permanence of natural laws, the question of the absolute existence of nature still remaIns open. It is the uniform effect of culture on the human mind, not to shake our faith in the stability of particular phenomena, as of heat, water, azote; but to lead us to regard nature as phenome ... nOD, not a substance; to attribute necessary existence to spirit; to esteem nature as an accident and an effect. To the senses and the unrenewed understanding, belongs a sort of instinctive belief in the absolute existence of nature. III their", "but to lead us to regard nature as phenome ... nOD, not a substance; to attribute necessary existence to spirit; to esteem nature as an accident and an effect. To the senses and the unrenewed understanding, belongs a sort of instinctive belief in the absolute existence of nature. III their view man and nature are indissolubly joined. Things are ulti .. mates, and they never look beyond their sphere. The presence of Reason mars this faith. The first effort of thought tends to relax this despotism of the senses which binds us to nature as if we were a part of it, and shows us nature aloof, and, as it were, afloat. Until this higher agency intervened, the animal eye sees, with wonderful accuracy, sharp outlines and colored surfaces. When the eye of Reason opens, to outline and surface are at once added grace and expression. These proceed from imagination and affec- tion, and abate somewhat of the angular distinctness of ob- jects. If the Reason be stimulated to more earnest vision, outlines and surfaces become transparent, and are no longer seen; causes NATURE and soirits are seen through them. The best moments of life are these \"delicious awakenings of the higher pow~rs, and the reveren ... tial withdrawing of nature before its God. Let us proceed to indicate the effects of culture. I. Our first institution in the Ideal philosophy is a hint from Nature herself.

A man who seldom rides, needs only Lo get into a coach and traverse his own town, to turn the street into a puppet-show. The men, the women-talking, running, bar- tering, fighting-the earnest mechanic, the lounger, the beggar, uhe boys, the dogs, are unrealized at once, or, at least, wholly de- tached from all relation to the observer, and seen as apparent, not substantial beings. \"That new thoughts are suggested by seeing a face of country quite familiar, in the rapid movement of the railroad car! Nay, the most wonted objects (make a very slight change in the point of vision), please us most. In a camera ob ... scura, the butcher's cart, and the figure of one of our own family amuse us. So a portrait of a well-known face gratifies us. Turn the eyes upside down, by looking at the land~cape through your legs, and how agreeable is the picture, though you have seen it any time these twenty years! In these cases, by mechanical means, is suggested the differ- ence between the observer and the spectacle-between man and nature. Hence arises a pleasure mixed with awe; I may say, a l()w degree of the sublime is felt, from the fact, probably, that man. is hereby apprized that whilst the world is a spectacle, something in himself is stable. 2.

In a higher manner the poet communicates the same pIcas ... ure. By a few strokes he delineates, as on air, the sun, the nloun .. tam, the camp, the city, the hero, the maiden, not different from what we know them, but only lifted from the ground and afloat before the eye. He unfixes the land and the sea, makes them re ... NATURE volve around the axis of his primary thought, and disposes them anew. Possessed himself by a heroic passion, he uses matter as symbols of it. The sensual man conforms thoughts to things; the poet conforms things to his thoughts. The one esteems nature as rooted and fast; the other, as fluid, and impresses his being there ... on. To him, the refractory world is ductile and flexible; he invests dust and stones with humanity, and makes them the words of the Reason. The Imagination may be defined to be the use which the Reason makes of the material world. Shakspeare possesses the power of subordinating nature for the purposes of expression, beyond all poets. -His imperial muse tosses the creation like a bauble from hand to hand, and uses it to embody any caprice ~ thought that is uppermost in his mind. The remotest spaces of nature are visited, and the farthest sundered things are brought together, by a subtile spiritual connection. We are made aware that magnitude of material things is relative, and all objects shrink and expand to serve the p~ssion of the poet. Thus in his sonnets, the lays of birds, the scents and dyes of flowers he finds to be the shadow of his beloved; time, which", "connection. We are made aware that magnitude of material things is relative, and all objects shrink and expand to serve the p~ssion of the poet. Thus in his sonnets, the lays of birds, the scents and dyes of flowers he finds to be the shadow of his beloved; time, which keeps her from bim, is his chest; the suspicion she has awakened, is her ornament,- The ornament of beauty is Suspect, A crow which flies in heaven's sweetest air. His passion is not the fruit of chance; it swells, as he speaks, to a city, or a state. No, it was builded far from accident; It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls Under the brow of thralling discontent; It fears not policy, that heretic, That works on leases of short numbered hours, But all alone stands hugely politic. In the strength of his constancy, the Pyramids seem to him re.- cent and transitory. The freshness of youth and love dazzles him with its resemblance to morning; 30 NATURE Take those lips away Which so sweetly were forsworn; And those eyes,-the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn. The wild beauty of this hyperbole, I may say in passing, it would not be easy to match in literature. This transfiguration which all material objects undergo through the passion of the poet-this power which he exerts to dwarf the great, to magnify the small-might be illustrated by a thousand e..~amples from his Plays. I have before me the Tem- pest, and will cite only these few lines. ARmL. The strong based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs plucked up The pine and cedar. Prospero calls for music to soothe the frantic Alonzo, and his \u2022 compamons; Again; A solemn air, ana the best comforter To an", "pest, and will cite only these few lines. ARmL.

Prospero calls for music to soothe the frantic Alonzo, and his \u2022 compamons; Again; A solemn air, ana the best comforter To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains N ow useless, boiled within thy skull. The charm dissolves apace, And, as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason. Their understanding Begins to swell: and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shores That now lie foul and muddy. The perception of real affinities between events (that is to say, of ideal affinities, for those only are real) , enables the poet thus to make free with the most imposing forms and phenomena of the world, and to assert the predominance of the soul. 3\u00b7 Whilst thus the poet animates nature with his own thoughts, he differs from the philosopher only herein, that the one proposes Beauty as his main end; the other Truth. But the phi .. NATURE 31 losopher, not less than the poet, postpones the apparent order and relations of things to the empire of thought. \"The problem of philosophy,\" according to Plato, \"is, for all that exists condition- ally, to find a ground unconditioned and absolute.\" It proceeds on the faith that a law determines all phenomena, which being known, the phenomena can be predicted. That law, when in the mind, is an idea. Its beauty is infinite. The true philosopher and the true poet are one, and a beauty, which is truth, and a truth~ which is beauty, is the aim of both. Is not the charm of one of Plato's", "can be predicted. That law, when in the mind, is an idea. Its beauty is infinite. The true philosopher and the true poet are one, and a beauty, which is truth, and a truth~ which is beauty, is the aim of both. Is not the charm of one of Plato's or Aristotle's definitions strictly like that of the Antigonc~ of Sophocles? It is, in both cases, that a spiritual life has been imparted to nature; that the solid seeming block of matter has been pervaded and dissolved by a thought; that this feeble human being has penetrated the vast masses of nature with an infornling soul, and recognized itself in their harmony, that is, seized their law. In physics, when this is attained, the memory disburthens itself of its cumbrous catalogues of particulars, 8nll carries centuries of observation in a single formula. Thus even in physics, the material is degraded before the spir .. ituaL The astronomer, the geometer, rely on their irrefragable analysis, and disdain the results of observation. The sublime re- mark of Euler on his law of arches, \"This will be found contrar)' to all experience, yet is true; \" had already transferred nature into the mind, and left matter like an outcast corpse. 4. Intellectual science has been observed to beget invariably a doubt of the existence of matter. Turgot said, \"He that has never doubted the existence of matter, may be assured he has no aptitude for metaphysical inquiries.\" It fastens the attention upon immortal necessary uncreated natures, that is, upon Ideas; and in their presence we feel that the outward circumstance is a dream and a shade. Whilst we wait in this Olympus of gods, we think of nature as an appendix to the soul. We ascend into their region, and know that these", "necessary uncreated natures, that is, upon Ideas; and in their presence we feel that the outward circumstance is a dream and a shade. Whilst we wait in this Olympus of gods, we think of nature as an appendix to the soul. We ascend into their region, and know that these are the thoughts of the Supreme Being. \"These are they who were set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, they were there; when he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep. Then they were NATURE by hinl, as one brought up with him. Of them took he counsel.\" Their influence is proportionate. As objects of science they are accessible to few men. Yet all men are capable of being raised by piety or by passion, into their region. And no man touches these divine natures, without becoming, in some degree, himself divine. , Like a new soul, they renew the body. We become physically nimble and lightsome; we tread on air; life is no longer irksome, and we think it will never be so. No man fears age or misfortune or death in their serene company, for he is transported out of the district of change. Whilst we behold unveiled the nature of Justice and Truth, we learn the difference between the absolute and the conditional or relative. We apprehend the absolute. As it were, for the first time, we exist. We become immortal, for we learn that time and space are relations of matter; that with a perception of truth or a virtuous will they have no affinity. 5. Finally, religion and ethics, which may be fitly called the practice of ideas, or the introduction of ideas into life, have an analogous effect with", "we learn that time and space are relations of matter; that with a perception of truth or a virtuous will they have no affinity. 5. Finally, religion and ethics, which may be fitly called the practice of ideas, or the introduction of ideas into life, have an analogous effect with all lower culture, in degrading nature and suggesting its dependence on spirit. Ethics and religion differ herein; that the one is the system of human duties commencing from man; the other, from God. Religion includes the personality of God; Ethics does not. They are one to our present design. They both put nature under foot. The first and last lesson of religion is, \"The things that are seen, are temporal; the things that are un ... 3een, are eternal.\" It puts an affront upon nature. It does that for !the unschooled, which philosophy does for Berkeley and Viasa. \u00b7The uniform language that may be heard in the churches of the most ignorant sects is-\"Contemn the unsubstantial shows of the . world; they are vanities, dreams, shadows, unrealities; seek the realities of religion.\" The devotee flouts nature. Some theoso- phists have arrived at a certain hostility and indignation towards matter, as the l\\fanichean and Plotinus. They distrusted in them- selves any looking back to these flesh-pots of Egypt. Plotinus was ashamed of his body_ In short, they might all say of matter what Micha~l Ang;Io said of external beauty, \"It is the frail and ~eary weed, m which God dresses the soul which he has called intc tim \" e ..

NATURE 33 It appears that motion, poetry, physical and intellectual sci- ence, and religion, all tend to affect our convictions of the reality of the external world. But lawn there is something ungrateful in expanding too curiously the particulars of the general proposi- tion, that all culture tends to imbue us with idealism. I have no hostility to nature, but a child's love to it. I expand and live in the warm day like corn and melons. Let us speak her fair. I do not wish to fling stones at my beautiful mother, nor soil my gentle nest. I only wish to indicate the true position of nature in regard t() man, wherein to establish man all right education tends; as the ground which to attain is the object of human life, that is, of man's connection with nature. Culture inverts the vulgar view of nature, and brings the mind to call that apparent which it uses to call real, and that real which it uses to call visionary. Children, it is true, believe in the external world. The belief that it appears only, is an afterthought, but with culture this faith will as surely arise on the mind as did the first. The advantage of the ideal theory over the popular faith is this, that it presents the world in precisely that view which is most desirable to the mind. It is, in fact, the view which Reason, both speCUlative and practical, that is, philosophy and virtue, take. For seen in the light of thought, the world always is phe .. nomenal; and virtue su bordina tes it to the mind. Idealism sees the world in God.

For seen in the light of thought, the world always is phe .. nomenal; and virtue su bordina tes it to the mind. Idealism sees the world in God. It beholds the whole circle of persons and things, of actions and events, of country and religion, not as pain- fully accumulated, atom after atom, act after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one vast picture which God paints on the instant eternity for the contemplation of the soul. Therefore the soul holds itself off from a too trivial and microscopic study of the universal tablet. It respects the end too much to immerse it\u00b7\u00b7 self in the means. It sees something more important in Christian .. ity than the scandals of ecclesiastical history or the niceties of criticism; and, very incurious concerning persons or miracles, and not at all disturbed by chasms of historical evidence, it accepts from God the phenomenon, as it finds it, as the pure and awful form of religion in the world. It is not hot and passionate at the appearance of what it calls its own good or bad fortuue, J4 NAT U RE at the union or opposition of other persons. No man is its enemy_ It accepts whatsoever befalls, as part of its lesson. It is a watcher more than a doer, and it is a doer, only that it may the better watch.

Uses that are exhausted or that may be, and facts that end in the statement, cannot be;. all that is true of this brave lodging wherein man is harbored, and wherein all his faculties find appropriate and endless exercise. And all the uses of nature admit of being summed in one, which yields the activity of man an infinite scope. Through all its kingdoms, to the suburbs and outskirts of things, it is faithful to the cause whence it had its origin. It always speaks of Spirit. It suggests the abso .. lute. It ~s a perpetual effect. It is a great shadow pointing always to the sun behind us. The aspect of Nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The dappiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship. Of that ineffable essence which we call Spirit, he that thinks most, will say least. We can foresee God in the coarse, and, as it were, distant phenomena of matter; but when we try to define and describe himself, both language and thought desert us, and \u00b7Ne are as helpless as fools and savages. That essence refuses to be recorded in propositions, but when man has worshipped him intel ... lectually, the noblest ministry of nature is to stand as the appari- tion of God. It is the organ through which the universal spirit 3peaks to the individual, and strives to lead back the individual to it. When we consider Spirit, we see that the views already pre ... sented do not include the whole circumference of man. We must add some related thoughts. Three problems are put by nature to the mind:", "spirit 3peaks to the individual, and strives to lead back the individual to it. When we consider Spirit, we see that the views already pre ... sented do not include the whole circumference of man. We must add some related thoughts. Three problems are put by nature to the mind: What is mat- :':er? Whe~ce is it? and Whereto? The first of these questions only, the Id~al theory answers. Idealism saith: matter is a phe .. NATURE 35 nomenOll, not a substance. Idealism acquaints us with the total disp21 rity bet,veen the evidence of our own being and the evidence. of the world's being. The one is perfect; the other, incapable of any assurance; the mind is a part of the nature of things; the world is a divine dream, from which we may presently awake to the glories and certainties of day. Idealism is a hypothesis to account for nature by other principles than those of carpentry and chemistry. Yet, if it only deny the existence of matter, it does not satisfy the demands of the spirit. It leaves God out of me. It leaves me in the splendid labyrinth of my perception~, to wander without end. Then the heart resists it, because it balks the affer- tions in denying substantive being to men and women. Nature is so pervaded with human life that there is something of humanity in all and in every particular. But this theory makes nature foreign to Ine, and does not account for that consanguinity which we acknowledge to it. Let it stand then, in the present state of our knowledge, merely as a useful introductory hypothesis, serving to apprize us of the eternal distinction between the soul and the world. But when, following the invisible steps of thoughts, we come to inquire, Whence", "consanguinity which we acknowledge to it. Let it stand then, in the present state of our knowledge, merely as a useful introductory hypothesis, serving to apprize us of the eternal distinction between the soul and the world. But when, following the invisible steps of thoughts, we come to inquire, Whence is matter? and Whereto? many truths arise to us out of the recesses of consciousness. We learn that the highest is present to the soul of man; that the dread universal essence, which is not wisdom, or love, or beauty, or power, but all in one, and each entirely, is that for which all things exist, and that by which they are; that spirit creates; that behind nature, through- out nature, spirit is present; one and not compound it does not act upon us froln without, that is, in space and time, but spiritu- ally, or through ourselves: therefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up nature around us, but puts it forth through us, as the life of the tree puts forth new branches and leaves through the pores of the old. As a plant upon the earth, so a man rests upon the bosom of God; be is nourished by un ... failing fountains, and draws at his need inexhaustible power. Who can set bounds to the possibilities of man? Once inhale the upper air, being admitted to behold the absolute natures of jus~ tice and truth, and we learn that man bas access to the entirf NATURE mind of the Creator, is himself the creator in the finite.

This view, which admonishes me where the sources of wisdom and power lie, and points to virtue as to \"The golden key Which opes the palace of eternity,\" carries upon its face the highest certificate of truth, because it animates me to create my own world through the purification of my soul. The world proceeds from the same spirit as the body of man. It is a remoter and inferior incarnation of God, a projection of God in the unconscious. But it differs from the body in one im\" portant respect. It is not, like that, now subjected to the human will. Its serene order is inviolable by us. It is, therefore, to us, the present expositor of the divine mind. It is a fixed point whereby we may measure our departure. As we degenerate, the contrast between us and our house is more evident. We are as much strangers in nature as we are aliens from God. We do not under .. stand the notes of birds. The fox and the deer run away from us; the bear and tiger rend us. 'Ne do not know the uses of more than a few plants, as corn and the apple, the potato and the vine. Is not the landscape: every glimpse of which hath a grandeur, a face of him? Yet this may show us what di5cord is between mal1 and nature, for you cannot freely admire a noble landscape if laborers are digging in the field hard by.

The poet finds some .. thing ridiculous in his delight until he is out of the sight of men. VIII PROSPECTS IN INQUIRms respecting the laws of the world and the frame of things, the highest reason is always the truest. That which seems faintly possible, it is so refined, is often faint and dim because it is deepest seated in the mind among the eternal verities. Empiri .. cal science is apt to cloud the sight, and by the very knowledge of functions and processes to bereave the student of the manly con .. templation of the whole. The savant becomes unpoetic. But the NATURE 37 best read naturalist who lends an entire and devout attention to truth, will see that there remains much to learn of his relation to the world, and that it is not to be learned by any addition or sub\"\" traction or other comparison of known quantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit, by a continual self-recovery, and by entire humility. He will perceive that there are far more excellent qualities in the student than preciseness and infallibil- ity; that a guess is often more fruitful than an indisputable affirmation, and that a dream may let us deeper into the secret of nature than a hundred concerted experiments. For the problems to be solved are precisely those which the physiologist and the naturalist omit to state. It is not so pertinent to man to know all the individuals of the animal kingdom, as it is to know whence and whereto is this tyrannizing unity in his con- stitution, which evermore separates and classifies things, endeav- oring to reduce the most diverse to one form. When I", "It is not so pertinent to man to know all the individuals of the animal kingdom, as it is to know whence and whereto is this tyrannizing unity in his con- stitution, which evermore separates and classifies things, endeav- oring to reduce the most diverse to one form. When I behold a rich landscape, it is less to my purpose to recite correctly the order and superposition of the strata, than to know why all thought of n1ultitude is lost in a tranquil sense of unity. I cannot greatly honor minuteness in details, so long as there is no hint to\u00b7 explain the relation between things and thoughts; no ray upoP. the metaphysics of conchology, of botany, of the arts, to show the relation of the f(, rms of flowers, shells, animals, architecture, to the mind, and build science upon ideas. In a cabinet of natural history, we become sensible of a certain occult recognition and sympathy in regard to the most unwieldy and eccentric form of beast, fish, and insect. The American who has been confined, in his own country, to the sight of buildings designed after foreign models, is surprised on entering York Minster or St. Peter's at Rome, by the feeling that these structures are imitations also~ faint copies of an invisible archetype. Nor has science sufficient humanity, so long as the naturalist overlooks that wonderful con .. gruity which subsists between man and the world; of which he is lord, not because he is the most subtile inhabitant, but because he is its head and heart, and finds something of himself in every great and small thing, in every mountain stratum, in every new law of color, fact of astronomy, or atmospheric influence which NATURE observa.tion or analysis lays open. A perception of this mystery inspires", "subtile inhabitant, but because he is its head and heart, and finds something of himself in every great and small thing, in every mountain stratum, in every new law of color, fact of astronomy, or atmospheric influence which NATURE observa.tion or analysis lays open. A perception of this mystery inspires the muse of George Herbert, the beautiful psalmist of the seventeenth century. The following lines are part of his little poem on Man. MRn is all symmetry, Full of proportions, one limb to another, And aU to all the world besides. Each part may call the farthest, brother; For head with foot hath private amity, And both with moons and tides. Nothing hath got so far But man hath caught and kept it as his prey; His eyes dismount the highest star: He is in little all the sphere. Herbs gladly cure our flesh, because that they Find their acquaintance there. For us, the winds do blow, The earth doth rest, heaven move, and fountains flow'; Nothing we see, but means our good, As our delight, or as our treasure; The whole is either our cupboard of food, Or cabinet of pleasure. The stars have us to bed: Night dra,\\\\\"s the curtain; which the sun withdraws. Music and light attend our head. ,,:\\11 things unto our flesh are kind, In their descent and being; to our mind, In their ascent and cause. ~1:ore servants wait on man Than he'll take notice of.

Oh mighty love! Man is one world, and hath Another to attend him. The perception of this class of truths makes the attraction which draws men to science, but the end is lost sight of in atten- NATURE 39 tion to the means. In view of this half-sight of science, we accept the sentence of Plato, that \"poetry comes nearer to vital truth than history.\" Every surmise and vaticination of the mind is entitled to a certain respect, and we learn to prefer imperfect theories, and sentences which contain glimpses of truth, to digested systems which have no one valuable suggestion. A wise writer will feel that the ends of study and composition are best answered by announcing undiscovered regions of thought, and so communicating, through hope, new activity to the torpid c;pirit. I shall therefore conclude this essay with some tradi Hons of man and nature, which a certain poet sang to me; and which, as they have always been in the world, and perhaps reappear to every bard, may be both history and prophecy. 'The foundations of man are not in matter, but in spirit. But the element of spirit is eternity. To it, therefore, t4e longest series of events, the oldest chronologies are young and :ecent. In the cycle of the universal man, from whom the l:nown individuals proceed, centuries are points, and all history is but the epoch of one degradation. 'We distrust and deny inwardly our sympathy with nature. We own and disown our relation to it, by turns. We are like Nebu- chadnezzar, dethroned, bereft of reason, and eating grass like an ox. But who can set limits to the remedial force of spirit? 'A man is a god in ruin. When men are", "our sympathy with nature. We own and disown our relation to it, by turns. We are like Nebu- chadnezzar, dethroned, bereft of reason, and eating grass like an ox. But who can set limits to the remedial force of spirit? 'A man is a god in ruin. When men are innocent, life shall b& longer, and shall pass into the immortal as gently as we awake from dreams. Now, the world would be insane and rabid, if these disorganizations should last for hundreds of years. It is kept. in check. by death and infancy. Infancy is the perpetual Messiah, which comes into the arms of fallen men, and pleads with them to return to paradise. 'Man is the dwarf of himself. Once he was permeated and dis- solved by spirit_ He filled nature with his overflowing currents. Out from him sprang the sun and moon; from man the sun, from woman the moon. The laws of his mind, the periods of his action~ externized themselves into day and night, into the year and th~ seasons. But, having made for himself this huge shell, his water..:: 40 NATURE retired; he no longer fills the veins and veinlets; he is shrunk to a drop. He sees that the structure still fits him, but fits him colas .. sally. Say, rather, once it fitted him, now it corresponds to him from far and on high. He adores timidly his own work. Now is man the follower of the sun, and woman the follower of the mOOD. Yet sometimes he starts in his slumber, and wonders at himself and his house, and muses strangely at the resemblance betwixt him and it. He perceives that if his law is still paramount, if still he have elemental power, if his word is sterling yet in nature,", "of the mOOD. Yet sometimes he starts in his slumber, and wonders at himself and his house, and muses strangely at the resemblance betwixt him and it. He perceives that if his law is still paramount, if still he have elemental power, if his word is sterling yet in nature, it is not conscious power, it is not inferior but superior to his will. It is instinct.' Thus my Orphic poet sang. At present, man applies to nature but half his force. He works on the world with his understanding alone. He lives in it and mas .. ters it by a penny-wisdom; and he that works most in it is but a half .. man, and whilst his arms are strong and his digestion good, bis mind is imbruted, and he is a selfish savage. His relation to\" nature, his power over it, is through the understanding, as by manure; the economic use of fire, wind, water, and the mariner's needle; steam., coal, chemical agriculture; the repairs of the human body by the dentist and the surgeon. This is such a re- c;umption of power as if a banished king should buy his territories inch by inch, instead of vaulting at once into his throne. Mean- time, in the thick darkness, there are not wanting gleams of a better light-occasional examples of the action of man upon nature with his entire force-with reason as well as understand- ing. Such examples are, the traditions of miracles in the earliest antiquity of all nations; the history of Jesus Christ; the achieve- ments of a principle, as in religious and political revolutions, and ill the abolition of the slave-trade; the miracles of enthusiasm, as those reported of Swedenborg, Hohenlohe, and the Shakers; many obscure and yet contested facts, now arranged under the", "of all nations; the history of Jesus Christ; the achieve- ments of a principle, as in religious and political revolutions, and ill the abolition of the slave-trade; the miracles of enthusiasm, as those reported of Swedenborg, Hohenlohe, and the Shakers; many obscure and yet contested facts, now arranged under the name of Animal Magnetism; prayer; eloquence; self-healing; and the wisdom of children. These are examples of Reason's mo- mentary grasp of the sceptre; the exertions of a power which exists not in time or space, but an instantaneous in-streaming causing power. The difference between the actual and the ideal force of man is happily figured by the schoolmen, in saying, that NATURE 41 the knowledge of man is an evening knowledge, vespertina cog .. nitio, but that of God is a morning knowledge, matutina cognitio. The problem of restoring to the world original and eternal beauty is solved by the redemption of the soul. The ruin or the blank. that we see when we look at nature, is in our own eye, The axis of vision is not coincident with the axis of things, and so they appear not transparent but opaque. The reason why the world lacks unity, and lies broken and in heaps, is because man is disunited with himself. He cannot be a naturalist until he sat- isfies all the demands of the spirit. Love is as much its demand as perception. Indeed, neither can be perfect without the other, In the uttermost meaning of the words, thought is devout, and devotion is thought. Deep calls unto deep. But in actual life, the marriage is not celebrated. There are innocent men who worship God after the tradition of their fathers, but their sense of duty lias not yet extended to the use of all their faculties. And", "thought is devout, and devotion is thought. Deep calls unto deep. But in actual life, the marriage is not celebrated. There are innocent men who worship God after the tradition of their fathers, but their sense of duty lias not yet extended to the use of all their faculties. And ther~ are patient naturalists, but they freeze their subject under the wintry light of the understanding. Is not prayer also a study of truth-a sally of the soul into the unfound infinite? No man ever prayed heartily without learning something. But when a faithful thinker, resolute to detach every object from personal relations and see it in the light of thought, shall, at the same time, kindle science with the fire of the holiest affections, then will God go forth anew into the creation . .. It will not need, when the mind is prepared for study, to search for objects. The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miracu- lous in the common. What is a day? What is a year? What is summer? What is woman? What is a child? What is sleep? To our blindness, these things seem unaffecting. We make fables to hide the baldness of the fact and conform it, as we say, to the higher law of the mind. But when the fact is seen under the light of an idea, the gaudy fable fades and shrivels. We behold the real higher law. To the wise, therefore, a fact is true poetry, and the most beautiful of fables. These wonders are brought to our own deor. You also are a man. Man and woman and their social life, poverty, labor, sleep, fear, fortune, are known to you. Learn that none of these things is superficial, but that each phenomenon bas 42 NATURE its", "the most beautiful of fables. These wonders are brought to our own deor. You also are a man. Man and woman and their social life, poverty, labor, sleep, fear, fortune, are known to you. Learn that none of these things is superficial, but that each phenomenon bas 42 NATURE its roots in the faculties and affections of the mind. Whilst the abstract question occupies your intellect, nature brings it in the concrete to be solved by your hands. It were a wise inquiry for the closet, to compare, point by point, especially at remarkable crises in life, our c1aily history with the rise and progress of ideas in the mind. So shall we come to look at the world with new eyes. It shall answer the endless inquiry of the intellect-What is truth? and of the affections-vVhat is good? by yielding itself passive to the, educated 'Ville Then shall come to pass what my poet said: 'Nature is not fixed but fluid. Spirit alters, moulds .. makes it. The immobility or bruteness of nature is the absence of spirit; to pure spirit it is fluid, it is volatile, it is obedient. Every spirit builds itself a house, and beyond its house a world, and beyond its world a ,heaven. Know then that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect. What we are, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all that Cresar eQuId, you have and can do. Adam called his house, heaven and earth; Cresar called his house, Rome; you perhaps call yours, a cobbler's trade; a hundred acres of ploughed land; or a scholar's garret.

As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind, that will unfold its great proportions. A correspondent revolution in things will attend .. the infiu.\"t of the spirit. So fast will disagreeable appearances, swine, spiders, snakes, pests, mad-houses, prisons, enemies, vanish; they are temporary and shall be no more seen. The sordor and filths of nature, the sun shall dry up and the wind exhale. As when the summer comes from the south the snow-banks melt and the face of the earth becomes green before it, so shall the advancing spirit create its ornaments along its path, and carry with it the beauty it visits and the song which enchants it; it shall draw beautiful faces, warm hearts: wise discourse, and heroic acts, around its way, until evil is no more seen. The kingdom of man over nature, which cometh not with observation-a dominion such as now is beyond his dream. of God-he shall enter without more wonder than the blind man feels who is gradually restored to sight.'

Nearly thirty years passed before Emerson was invited again to speak at Harvard.] AN ADDRESS IN THIS refulgent summer, it has been a luxury to draw the breath of life. The grass grows, the buds burst, the meadow is spotted with fire and gold in the tint of flowers. The air is full of birds, and sweet with the breath of the pine, the balm .. of .. Gilead, and the new hay. Night brings no gloom to the heart with its welcome shade. Through the transparent darkness the stars pour their almost spiritual rays. l\\lan under them seems a young child, and his huge globe a toy. The cool night bathes the world as with a river, and prepares his eyes again for the crimson dawn. The mystery of nature was never displayed more happily. Th~ corn and the wine have been freely dealt to all creatures, and the never-broken silence with which the old bounty goes forward has not yielded yet one word of explanation. One is constrained to respect the perfection of this world in which our senses can .. verse. How wide; how rich; what invitation from every property it gives to every faculty of man! In its fruitful soils; in its navi, gable sea; in its mountains of metal and stone; in its forests of all woods; in its animals; in its chemical ingredients; in the powers and path of light, heat, attraction and life, it is well worth the", "to every faculty of man! In its fruitful soils; in its navi, gable sea; in its mountains of metal and stone; in its forests of all woods; in its animals; in its chemical ingredients; in the powers and path of light, heat, attraction and life, it is well worth the pith and heart of great men to subdue and enj oy it. The plant- ers, the mechanics, the inventors, the astronomers, the builders of cities, and the captains, history delights to honor. But when the mind opens and reveals the laws which traverse the universe and make things what they are, then 5hrinks the great world at once into a mere illustration and fable of this mind .. \\Vhat am I? and What is? asks the hUlnan spirit with a curiosity new-kindled, but never to be quenched. Behold these outrunning laws, which our imperfect apprehension can see tend this way and that, but not come full circle. Behold these infinite relations, So' like, so unlike; many, yet one. I would study, I would know, I would admire forever. These works of thought have been the en- tertainments of the human spirit in all ages. 67 AN ADDRESS and all things conspire with it. Whilst a man seeks good ends, he is strong by the whole strength of nature. In so far as he roves from these ends, he bereaves himself of power, or auxiliaries; his being shrinks out of all remote channels, he becomes less and less, a mote, a point, until absolute badness is absolute death. The perception of this law of laws awakens in the mind a sen- timent which we call the religious sentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its power to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. It is the", "point, until absolute badness is absolute death. The perception of this law of laws awakens in the mind a sen- timent which we call the religious sentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its power to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. It is the embalmer of the world. It is rrlyrrh and storax, and chlorine and rosemary. It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and the silent song of the stars is it. By it is the universe made safe and habitable, not by science or power. Thought may work cold and intransitive in things, and find no end or unity; but the dawn of the sentiment of virtue on the heart, gives and is the assurance that Law is sovereign over all natures; and the worlds, time, space, eternity, do seem to break out into joy. This sentiment is divine and deifying. It is the beatitude of \u2022 man. It makes him illimitable. Through it, the soul first knows itself. It corrects the capital mistake of the infant man, who seeks to be great by following the great, and hopes to derive advantages from another-by showing the fountain of all good to be in himself, and that he, equally with every man, is an inlet into the deeps of Reason. \\Vhen he says, \"1 ought;\" when love warms him; when he chooses, warned from on high, the good and great deed; then, deep melodies wander through his soul from Supreme \\Visdom. Then he can worship, and be enlarged by his worship; for he can never go behind this sentiment. In the sub .. limest flights of the soul, rectitude is never surmounted, love is never outgrown ..

The sen- AN ADDRESS 71 tences of the oldest time, which ejaculate this piety, are still fresh and fragrant. This thought dwelled always deepest in the minds of men in the devout and contemplative East; not alone in Pales- tine, where it reached its purest expression, but in Egypt, in Per- sia, in India, in China. Europe has always owed to oriental genius its divine impulses. What these holy bards said, all sane men found agreeable and true. And the unique impression of Jesus upon mankind, whose name is not so much written as ploughed into the history of this world, is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion. Meantime, whilst the doors of the temple stand open, night and day, before every man, and the oracles of this truth cease never, it is guarded by one stern condition; this, namely, it is an intui- tion. It cannot be received at second hand. Truly speaking, it is not instructioIi, but provocation, that I can receive from another soul.

Truly speaking, it is not instructioIi, but provocation, that I can receive from another soul. What he announces, I must find true in me, or reject; and on his word, or as his second, be he who he may, I can accept nothing. On the contrary, the absence of this primary faith is the presence of degradation. As is the flood, so is the ebb. Let this faith depart, and the very words it spake and the things it made become false and hurtful. Then falls the church, the state, art, letters, life. The doctrine of the divine nature being forgotten, a sickness infects and dwarfs the constitution. Once man was all; now he is an appendage, a nuisance. And because the indwelling Supreme Spirit cannot wholly be got rid of, the doctrine of it suffers this perversion, that the divine nature is attributed to ore or two persons, and denied to all the rest, and denied with fury. The doctrine of inspiration is lost; the base doctrine of the ma- jority of voices usurps the place of the doctrine of the soul. Mir- acles, prophecy, poetry, the ideal life, the holy life, exist as ancient history merely; they are not in the belief, nor in the aspi ... ration of society; but, when suggested, seem ridiculous. Life is comic or pitiful as soon as the high ends of being fade out of sight, and man becomes near-sighted, and can only attend tu what addresses the senses.

These general views, which, whilst they are general, none will contest, find abundant illustration in the history of religion, and AN ADDRESS especially in the history of the Christian church. In that, all of ' us have had our birth and nurture. The truth contained in that, you, my young friends, are now setting forth to teach. As the Cultus, or established worship of the civilized world, it has great historical interest for us. Of its blessed words, which have been the consolation of humanity, you need not that I should speak. I shall endeavor to discharge my duty to you on this occasion, by pointing out two errors in its administration, which daily appear more gross from the point of view we have just now taken. Jesus Christ belonged to the true race of prophets. He saw with open eye the mystery of the soul. Drawn by its severe har- mony, ravished with its beauty, he lived in it, and had his being there. Alone in all history he estimated the greatness of man. One man was true to what is in you and me. He saw that God in .. carnates himself in man, and evermore goes forth anew to take possession of his \\Vorld. He said, in this jubilee of sublime emo .. tion, 'I am divine. Through me, God acts; through me, speaks. \\Vould you see God, see me; or see thee, when thou also thinkest as I now think.' But what a distortion did his doctrine and mem- ory suffer in the same, in the next, and the following ages! There is no doctrine of the Reason which will beaL to be taught by the Understanding. The understanding caught this high chant from the poet's lips,", "I now think.' But what a distortion did his doctrine and mem- ory suffer in the same, in the next, and the following ages! There is no doctrine of the Reason which will beaL to be taught by the Understanding. The understanding caught this high chant from the poet's lips, and said, in the next age, ~1'his was J ebovah come do~n out of heaven. I will kill you, if you say he was a man.' The idioms of his language and the figures of his rhetoric have usurped th~ place of his truth; and churches are not built on his principles, but on his tropes. Christianity became a ~Iythus, as the poetic teaching of Greece and of Egypt, before. He spoke of miracles; \" for he felt that man's life was a miracle, and all that man doth, and he knew that this daily miracle shines as the character RScends. But the word l\\liracle, as pronounced by Christian churches, gives a false impression; it is lVlonster .. It is not one with the blowing clover and the falling rain .. He felt respect for l\\loses and the prophets, but no unfit ten ... derness at postponing their initial revelations to the hour and the man that now is; to the eternal revelation in the heart. Thus was he a true man. Having seen that the law in us is commanding. he \" AN ADDRESS 73 would not suffer it to be commanded. Boldly, with hand, and heart, and life, he declared it was God. Thus is he, as I think, the only soul in history who has appreciated the worth of man. I. In this point of view we become sensible of the first defect of historical Christianity. Historical Christianity has fallen into the error that corrupts all attempts", "he declared it was God. Thus is he, as I think, the only soul in history who has appreciated the worth of man. I. In this point of view we become sensible of the first defect of historical Christianity. Historical Christianity has fallen into the error that corrupts all attempts to communicate religion. As it appears to us, and as it has appeared for ages, it is not the doc- trine of the soul, but an exaggeration of the personal, the positive, the ritual. It has dwelt, it dwells, with noxious exaggeration about the person of Jesus. The soul knows no persons. It invites every man to expand to the full circle of the universe, and will have no preferences but those of spontaneous love. But by this eastern monarchy of a Christianity, which indolence and fear have built, the friend of man is made the injurer of man. The manner in which his name is surrounded with expressions which were once sallies of admiration and love, but are now petrified into official titles, kills all generous sympathy and liking. All who hear me, feel that the language that describes Christ to Europe' and America is not the style of friendship and enthusiasm to a good and noble heart, but is appropriated and formal-paints a demi- god, as the Orientals or the Greeks would describe Osiris or Apollo. Accept the injurious impositions of our early catechetical instruction, and even honesty and self-denial were but splendid sins, if they did not wear the Christian name. One would rather be \"A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,\" than to be defrauded of his manly right in coming into nature and finding not names and places, not land and professions, but even virtue and truth foreclosed and monopolized. You shall not be a", "wear the Christian name. One would rather be \"A pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,\" than to be defrauded of his manly right in coming into nature and finding not names and places, not land and professions, but even virtue and truth foreclosed and monopolized. You shall not be a man even. You shall not own the world; you shall not dare and live after the infinite Law that is in you, and in company with the infinite Beauty which heaven and earth reflect to you in all lovely forms; but you must subordinate your nature to Christ's nature; you must accept our interpretations, and take his portrait as the vulgar draw it. That is always best which gives me to myself. The sublime is excited in me by the great stoical doctrine, Obey thyself. That 74 AN ADDRESS which shows God in me, fortifies me. That which shows God out of me, makes me a wart and a wen. There is no longer a necessary reason for my being. Already the long shadows of untimely oblivion creep over me, and I shall decease forever. The divine bards are the friends of my virtue, of my intellect, of my strength. They admonish me that the gleams which flash across my mind are not mine, but God's; that they had the like, and were not disobedient to the heavenly vision. So I love them. Noble provocations go out from them, inviting me to resist evil; to subdue the world; and to Be. And thus, by his holy thoughts, Jesus serves us, and thus only. To aim to convert a man by mira- cles is a profanation of the soul. A true conversion, a true Christ, is now, as always, to be made by the reception of beautiful senti ... ments. It", "Be.

It is true that a great and rich soul, like his, falling among the simple, does so preponderate, that, as hi'\" did, it names the world .. The world seems to them to exist f01 him, and they have not yet drunk so deeply of his sense as to see that only by coming again to themselves, or to God in themselves, can they grow for- evermore. It is a low benefit to give me something; it is a high benefit to enable me to do somewhat of myself. The time is com .. ing when all men will see that the gift of God to the soul is not a vaunting, overpowering, excluding sanctity, but a sweet, natural goodness, a goodness like thine and mine, and that so invItes thine and mine to be and to grow. The injustice of the vulgar tone of preaching is not less flagrant to Jesus than to the souls which it profanes. The preachers do not see that they make his gospel not glad, and shear him of the locks of beauty and the attributes of heaven.

And so lovely, and with yet more entire consent of my human being, sounds in my ear the c;evere music of the bards that have sung of the true God in all ages. Now do not degrade the life and dialogues of Christ out of the circle of this charm, by insulation and peculiarity. Let them lie as they befell, alive and warm, part of human life and the landscape and the cheerful day. AN ADDRESS 75 2. The second defect of the traditionary and limited way of using the mind of Christ is a consequence of the first; this, namely; that the Moral Nature, that Law of laws whose revela- tions introduce greatness-yea, God himself-into the open soul, is not explored as the fountain of the established teaching in society. Men have come to speak of the revelation as somewhat long ago given and done, as if God were dead. The injury to faith throttles the preacher; and the goodliest of institutions becomes an uncertain and inarticulate voice. It is very certain that it is the effect of conversation with the beauty of the soul, to beget a desire and need to impart to others the same knowledge and love. If utterance is denied, the thought lies like a burden on the man. Always the seer is a sayer. Some- how his dream is told; somehow he publishes it with solemn joy: sometimes with pencil on canvas, sometimes with chisel on stone, sometimes in towers and aisles of granite, his soul's worship is builded; sometimes in anthems of indefinite music; but clearest and most permanent, in words.

The man enamored of this excellency becomes its priest or poet. The office is coeval with the world. But observe the condi- tion, the spiritual linlitation of the office. The spirit only can teach. Not any profane man, not any sensual, not any liar, not any slave can teach, but only he can give, who has; he only can create, who is. The man on whom the soul descends, through whom the soul speaks, alone can teach. Courage, piety, love, wis- dom, can teach; and every man can open his door to these angels, and they shall bring him the gift of tongues. But the man who aims to speak as books e11able, as synods use, as the fashion guides, and as interest commands, babbles. Let him hush. To this holy office you propose to devote yourselves. I wish you may feel your call in throbs of desire and hope. The office is the first in the world. It is of that reality that it cannot suffer the deduction of any falsehood. And it is my duty to say to you that the need was never greater of new revelation than now. From, the views I have already expressed, you will infer the sad conviction, which I share, I believe, with numbers, of the uni- versal decay and now almost death of faith in society.

On this occasion, any complaisance would be criminal which told you, whose hope and commission it is to preach the faith of Christ, that the faith of Christ is preached. It is time that this ill-suppressed murmur of all thoughtful men against the famine of our churches; this moaning of the heart because it is bereaved of the consolation, the hope, the grandeur that come alone out of the culture of the moral nature- should be heard through the sleep of indolence, and over the din of routine. This great and perpetual office of the preacher is not discharged. Preaching is the expression of the moral sentiment in application to the duties of life. In bow many churches, by how many prophets, tell me, is man made sensible that he is an infinite Soul; that the earth and heavens are pass- ing into his mind; that he is drinking forever the soul of God? Where now sounds the persuasion, that by its very melody imparadises my heart, and so affirms its own origin in heaven? Where shall I hear words such as in elder ages drew men to leave all and follow-father and mother, house and land, wife and child? Where shall I hear these august laws of moral being so pronounced as to fill my ear, and I feel ennobled by the offer of my uttermost action and passion? The test of the true faith, certainly, should be its power to charm and command the soul, as the laws of nature control the activity of the hands- so commanding", "so pronounced as to fill my ear, and I feel ennobled by the offer of my uttermost action and passion? The test of the true faith, certainly, should be its power to charm and command the soul, as the laws of nature control the activity of the hands- so commanding that we find pleasure and honor in obeying. The faith should blend with the light of rising and of setting suns, with the flying cloud, the singing bird, and the breath of flowers. But now the priest's Sabbath has lost the splendor of nature; it is unlovely; we are glad when it is done; we can 'make, we do make, even sitting in our pews, a far better, holier, sweeter, for ourselves. Whenever the pUlpit is usurped by a formalist, then is the worshipper defrauded and disconsolate. \\Ve shrink as soon as the prayers begin, which do not uplift, but smite and offend us. We are fain to wrap our cloaks about us, and secure, as best we can, a solitude that hears not. I once heard a preacher who sorely tempted me to say I would go to church no more. AN ADDRESS 77 ~1en go, thought I, where they are wont to go, else had no soul entered the temple in the afternoon. A snow .. storm was falling around us. The snow-storm was real, the preacher merely spectral, and the eye felt the sad contrast in looking at him, and then out of the window behind him into the beautiful meteor of the snow. He had lived in vain. He had no one word intimating that he had laughed or wept, was married or in love, had been commended, or cheated, or chagrined.

He had no one word intimating that he had laughed or wept, was married or in love, had been commended, or cheated, or chagrined. If he had ever lived and acted, we were none the wiser for it. The capital secret of his profession, namely, to convert life into truth, he had not learned. Not one fact in all his experience had he yet imported into his doctrine. This man had ploughed and planted and talked and bought and sold; he had read books; he had eaten and drunken; his head aches, his heart throbs; he smiles and suffers; yet was there not a surmise, a hint, in all the dis ... course, that he had ever lived at alL Not a line did he draw out of real history. The true preacher can be known by this, that he deals out to the people his life-life passed through the fire of thought. But of the bad preacher, it could not be told from his sermon what age of the world he fell in; whether he had a father or a child; whether he was a freeholder or a pauper; whether he was a citizen or a countryman; or any other fact of his biography. It seemed strange that the people should come to church. It seemed as if their houses were very unentertaining, that they should prefer this thoughtless clamor. It shows that there is a commanding attraction in the moral sentiment, that can lend a faint tint of light to dulness and ignorance coming in its name and place.

When he listens to these vain words, he comforts himself by their relation to his remembrance of better hours, and so they clatter and echo unchallenged. I am not ignorant that when we preach unworthily, it is not always quite in vain. There is a good ear, in some men, that draws supplies to virtue out of very indifferent nutriment. There is poetic truth concealed in all the commonplaces of AN ADDRESS prayer and of sermons, and though foolishly spoken, they may be wisely heard; for each is some select eA-pression that broke out in a moment of piety from some stricken or jubilant soul, and its excellency made it remembered. The prayers and even the dogmas of our church are like the zodiac of Denderah and the astronomical monuments of the Hindoos, wholly insulated from anything now extant in the life and business of the people. They mark the height to which the waters once rose. But this docility is a check upon the mischief from the good and devout. In a large portion of the community, the religious service gives rise to quite other thoughts and emotions. We need not chide the negligent servant. ,\\\\Te are struck with pity, rather, at the swift retribution of his sloth.

Every- thing that befalls, accuses him. Would he ask contributions for the missions, foreign or dOlnestic? Instantly his face is suffused with shame, to propose to his parish that they should send money a hundred or a thousand miles, to furnish such poor fare as they have at home and would do well to go the hundred or the thousand miles to escape. Would he urge people to a godly way of living; and can he ask a fellow .. creature to come to Sabbath meetings, when he and they all know what is the poor uttermost they can hope for therein? Will he invite them privately to the Lord's Supper? He dares not. If no heart warm this rite, the hollow, dry, creaking formality is too plain, than that he can face a man of wit and energy and put the invitation without terror. In the street, what has he to say to the bold village blasphemer? The village blasphemer sees fear in the face, form, and gait of the minister. Let me not taint the sincerity of this plea by any oversight of th~ claims of good men. I know and honor the purity and strict conscience of numbers of the clergy. What life the public worship retains, it owes to the scattered company of pious men who minister here and there in the churches, and who, some~ times accepting with too great tenderness the tenet of the elders , have not accepted frum others, but from their own heart, the genuine impulses of virtue, and so still command our love and ... .

But, with whatever exceptioD, It is still true that tradition characterizes the preaching vI this co un .. try; that it comes out of the memory, and not out: of the soul; that it aims at what is usual, and not at what is necessary and eternal; that thus historical Christianity destroys the power of preaching, by withdrawing it from the exploration of the moral nature of man; where the sublime is, where are the resources of astonishment and power. What a cruel injustice it is to that Law, the joy of the whole earth, which alone can make thought dear and rich; that Law whose fatal sureness the astronomical orbits poorly emulate; that it is travestied and depreciated, that it is behooted and behowled, and not a trait, not a word of it articulated. The pulpit in losing sight of this Law, loses its reason, and gropes after it knows not what. And for want of this culture the soul of the community is sick and faithless. It wants nothing so much as a stern, high, stoical~ Christian discipline, to make it know itself and the divinity that speaks through it.

Now man is ashamed of himself; he skulks and sneaks through the world, to be tolerated, to be pitied, and scarcely in a thousand years does any man dare to be wise and good, and so draw after him the tears and bless- ings of his kind . Certainly there have been periods when, from the inactivity of the intellect on certain truths, a greater faith was possible in names and persons. The Puritans in England and America found in the Christ of the Catholic Church and in the dogmas inherited from Rome, scope for their austere piety and their longings for civil freedom. But their creed is passing away, and none arises in its room. I think no man can go with his thoughts about him into one of our churches, without feeling that what hold the public worship had on men is gone, or going. It has lost its grasp on the affection of the good and the fear of the bad. In the country, neighborhoods, half parishes are signing off, to use the local term. It is already beginning to indicate char- Bo AN ADDRESS acter and religion to withdraw from the religious meetings. I have heard a devout person, who prized the Sabbath, say in bitterness of heart, \"On Sundays, it seems wicked to go to church.\" And the motive that holds the best there is now only a hope and a waiting.

And what greater calamity can fall upon a nation than the loss of worship? Then all things go to decay. Genius leaves the temple to haunt the senate or the market. Literature becomes frivolous. Science is cold. The eye of youth is not lighted by the hope of other worlds, and age is without honor. Society lives to trifles, and when men die we do not mention them. And now, my brothers, you will ask, \\Vhat in these desponding days can be done by us?

It is' the office of a true teacher to show us that God is, not was; that He speaketh, not spake. The true Christianity-a faith like Christ's in the infinitude of men-is lost. None believeth in the soul of man but only in some man or person old and departed. Ah me! n~ ma~ ~oeth alone. All men go in flocks to this saint or that poet, aVOIdIng the God who seeth in secret. They cannot see in secret; they love to be blind in pUblic. They think society wiser AN ADDRESS 81 ... than their SOH1, and know not that one soul, and their soul, is wiser than the whole world.

None assayeth the stern ambition to be the Self of the nation and of nature, but each would be an easy secondary to some Christian scheme, or sectarian connection, or some eminent man. Once leave your own knowledge of God, your own sentiment, and take secondary knowledge, as St. Paul's, or George Fox's, or Swedenborg's, and you get wide from God with every year this secondary form lasts, and if, as now, for centuries-the chasm yawns to that breadth, that men can scarcely be convinced there is in them anything divine.

Imitation cannot go above its model. The imitator dooms hlmself to hopeless medioc- rity. The inventor did it because it was natural to him, and so in him it has a charm.

For all our penny-wisdom, for all our soul-destroying slavery to habit, it is not to be doubted that f all men have sublime thoughts; that all men value the few real hours of life; they love to be heard; .. they love to be caught up into the vision of principles.

Discharge to men the priestly office, and, present or absent, you shall be followed with their love as by an angel. And, to this end, let us not aim at common degrees of merit. Can we not leave, to such as love it, the virtue that glitters for the commendation of society, and ourselves pierce the deep solitudes of absolute ability and worth? We\" easily come up to the standard of goodness in society. Society's praise can be cheaply secured, and almost all men are content with those easy merits; but the instant effect of conversing with God will be to put them away_ There are persons who are not actors, not speakers, but influences; persons too great for fame, for display; who disdain eloquence; to whom all we call art and artist, seems too nearly allied to show and by-ends, to the exaggeration", "of conversing with God will be to put them away_ There are persons who are not actors, not speakers, but influences; persons too great for fame, for display; who disdain eloquence; to whom all we call art and artist, seems too nearly allied to show and by-ends, to the exaggeration of the finite and selfish, and loss of the universal.

One needs not praise their courage-they are the heart and soul of nature. o my friends, there are resources in us on which we have not drawn. There are men who rise refreshed on hearing a threat; men to whom a crisis which intimidates and paralyzes the majority-demanding not the faculties of prudence and thriftl but comprehension, immovableness, ~he readip.ess of sacrifice- CaInes graceful and beloved as a bride.

It was printed in The Dial j4J1 January, 1843.] THE TRANSCENDENTALIsrr THE first thing we have to say respecting what are called new views here in New E.ngland, at the present time, is, that they are not new, but the very oldest of thoughts cast into the mould of these new times.

What is popularly called Transcen- dentalism among us, is Idealism; Idealism as it appears in 1842. As thinkers, mankind have ever divided into two sects, Mate- rialists and Idealists; the first class founding on experience, the second on consciousness; the first class beginning to think from the data of the senses, the second class perceive that the senses are not final, and say, The senses give us representations of things, but what are the things themselves, they cannot telL The materialist insists on facts, on history, on the force of circumstances and the animal wants of man; the idealist on the power of Thought and of Will, on inspiration, on miracle) on individual culture. These two modes of thinking are b\u20ac>th natural, but the idealist contends that his way of thinking is in higher nature. He concedes all that the other affirms, admits the impressions of sense, admits their coherency, their use and beauty, and then asks the materialist for his grounds of assurance that things are as his senses represent them. But I, he says, affirm facts not affected by the illusions of sense, facts which are of the same nature as the faculty which reports them, and not liable to doubt; facts which in their first appearance to us assume a native superiority to material facts, degrading these into a language by which the first are to be spoken; facts which it only needs a retirement from the senses", "nature as the faculty which reports them, and not liable to doubt; facts which in their first appearance to us assume a native superiority to material facts, degrading these into a language by which the first are to be spoken; facts which it only needs a retirement from the senses to discern. Every materialist will be an idealist; but an idealist can never gQ bacl{ward to be a materialist. l . .. B7 ~ 88 THE :tRANSCENDENTALIST The idealist, in speaking of events, sees them as spirits. He does not deny the sensuous fact: by no means; but he will not see that alone. He does not deny the presence of this table, this chair, and the walls of tbis room, but he lool~s at these things as the reverse side of the tapestry, as the other end, each being a sequel or completion of a spiritual fact which nearly concerns him. This manner of looking at things transfer.s every object in nature from an independent and anomalous position without there, into the consciousness. Even the materialist Con- dillac, perhaps the most logical expounder of materialism, was constrained to say, \"Though we should soar into the heavens, though we should sink into the abyss, we never go out of our- selves; it is always our own thoughts that we perceive.\" What more could an idealist say? The materialist, secure in the certainty of sensation, mocks at fine-spun theories, at star-gazers and dreams, and believes that his life is solid, that he at least takes nothing for granted, but knows where he stands, and what he does. Yet how easy it is to show him that he also is a phantom walking and work- ing amid phantoms, and that he need only ask a question or two beyond his daily questions", "he at least takes nothing for granted, but knows where he stands, and what he does. Yet how easy it is to show him that he also is a phantom walking and work- ing amid phantoms, and that he need only ask a question or two beyond his daily questions to find his solid universe grow- ing dim and impalpable before his sense. The sturdy capitalist, no matter how deep and square on blocks of Quincy granite he lays the foundations of his banking-house or Exchange, must set it, at last, not on a cube corresponding to the angles of his structure, but on a mass of unknown materials and solidity, red- hot or white-hot perhaps at the core, which rounds off to an almost perfect sphericity, and lies floating in soft air, and goes spinning away, dragging bank and banker with it at a rate of thousands of miles the hour, he knows not whitber-a bit of bullet, now glimmering, now darkling through a small cubic space on the edge of an unimaginable pit of emptiness. And this wild balloon, in which his whole venture is embarked, is a just symbol of his whole state and faculty. One thing at least, he says, is certain, and does not give me the headache, that figures do not lie; the multiplication table has been hitherto found unimpeachable truth; and, moreover, if I put a gold THE TRANSCENDENTALIST eagle in my safe, I find it again to-morrow; but for these thoughts, I know not whence they are.

But ask him why he believes that an uniform experience will continue uniform, or on what grounds he founds his faith in his figures, and he will perceive that his mental fabric is built up on just as strange and quaking foundations as his proud edifice of stone. In the order of thought, the materialist takes his departure from the external world, and esteems a man as one product of that. The idealist takes his departure from his consciousness, and reckons the world an appearance. The materialist respects sensible masses, Society, Government, social art and luxury,. every establishment, every mass, whether majority of numbers, or extent of space, or amount of objects, every social action The idealist has another measure, which is metaphysical, namely the rank which things themselves take in his consciousness; not at all the size or appearance. l\\1ind is the only re(l.lity, of which men and all other natures are better or '\u00a5orse reflectors. Nature, literature, history, are only subjective phenomena. Although in his action overpowered by the laws of action, and so, warmly co-operating with nlen, _ even preferring them to himself, yet when he speaks scientifically, or after the order of thought, he is constrained to degrade persons into representatives of trutns. He does not respect labor, or the products of labor, namely property, otherwise than as a manifold symbol, illustrating with wonderful fidelity of details the laws of being; he does not respect government, except as far as it reiterates the law of his mind; nor the church, nor charities, nor arts, for themselves; but hears, as at a vast distance, what they say, as if his con ... sciousness would speak to him through a pantomimic scene.

His thought-that is the Universe. His experience inclines him to behold the procession of facts you call the world, as flowing perpetually outward from an invisible, unsounded centre in himself, centre alike of him and of them, and necessitating him to regard all things as having a subjective Ot relative existence, relative to that aforesaid Unknown Centre of him. From this transfer of the world into the consciousness, this THE TRANSCENDENTALIST beholding of all things in the mind, follow easily his whole ethics. It is simpler to be self-dependent. The height, the deity of man is to be self-sustained, to need no gift, no foreign force. , Society is good when it does not violate me, but best when it is likest to solitude. Everything real is self-existent. Everything divine shares the self-existence of Deity. All that you call the world is the shadow of that substance which you are, the per- petual creation of the powers of thought, of those that are dependent and of those that are independent of your will. Do not cumber yourself with fruitless pains to mend and remedy remote effects; let the soul be erect, and all things will go well. You think me the child of my circumstances: I make my cir- cumstances. Let any thought or motive of mine be different from that they are, the difference will transform my condition and economy.

The Transcendentalist adopts the whole connection of spirit- ual doctrine. He believes in rni.racle, in the perpetual openness of the human mind to new influx of light and power; he be- lieves in inspiration, and in ecstasy. He wishes that the spiritual principle should be suffered to demonstrate itself to the end, in all possible applications to the state of man, without the admission of anything unspiritual: that is, anything positive, dogmatic, personal. Thus the spiritual measure of inspiration is the depth of the thought, and never, who said it? And sc THE TRANSCENDENTALIST 91 he resists all attempts to palm other rules and measures on the spirit than its own. In action he easily incurs the charge of anti-nomianism by his avowal", "Thus the spiritual measure of inspiration is the depth of the thought, and never, who said it?

In the play of Othello, the expiring Desdemona absolves her husband of the murder, to her attendant Emilia. After ... wards, when Emilia charges him with the crime, Othello ex .. claims, .-. .... \" tcYou heard her say herself it was not I.\" c Emilia replies, c:-' \"The more angel she, and thou the blacker devil.\" Of this fine incident, Jacobi, the Transcendental moralist. makes use, with other parallel instances, in his reply to Fichte\" Jacobi, refusing all measure of right and wrong except the d~terminations of the private spirit, remarks that there is no crime but :q.as sometimes been a virtue .. \"1,\" he says, \"am that atheist, that godless person who, in opposition to an imaginary doctrine of calculation, would lie as the dying Desdemona lied; would lie and deceive, as Pylades when he personated Orestes; would assassinate like Timoleon; would perjure myself like Epaminondas and John de Witt; I would resolve on suicide like Cato; 1 would commit sacrilege with David; yea, and pluck ears of corn on the Sabbath, for no other reason than that I was fainting for lack of food. For I have assurance in myself that in pardoning these faults according to the letter, man exerts the sovereign right which the majesty of his being confers on him; he sets the seal of his divine nature to the grace he accords.\" In", "I was fainting for lack of food. For I have assurance in myself that in pardoning these faults according to the letter, man exerts the sovereign right which the majesty of his being confers on him; he sets the seal of his divine nature to the grace he accords.\" In like manner, if there is anything grand and daring in human thought or virtue, any reliance 011 the vast, the unknown; any presentiment, any extravagance of faith, the spiritualist adopts it as most in nature. The oriental mind has always tended to this largeness. Buddhism is an expression of it. The Buddhist, THE TRANSCENDENTALIST who tha.nks no man, who says, \"Do not flatter your benefactors,\" but who, in his conviction that every good deed can by no possibility escape its reward, will not deceive the benefactor by pretending that he has done more than he should, is a Tran .. icendentalist. \u00b7 You will see by this sketch that there is no such thing as a Transcendental party; that there is no pure Transcendentalist; that we know of none but prophets and heralds of such a philosophy; that all who by strong bias of nature have leaned t9 the spiritual side in doctrine, have stopped short of their goal. We have had nlany harbingers and forerunners; but of a purely spiritual life, history has afforded no example. I mean we have yet no man who has leaned entirely on his character, and eaten angels' food; \\\\'\"ho, trusting to his sentiments, found life made of miracles; who:, working for universal aims, found himself fed, he knew not how; clothed, sheltered, and weaponed, he knew not how, and yet it was done by his own bands.

Only in the instinct of the lower animals we find the suggestion of the methods of it, and something higher than our understanding. The. squirrel hoards nuts and the bee gathers honey, without knowing what they do, and they are thus provided for without selfishness or disgrace. Shall we say then that Transcendentalism is the Saturnalia or excess of Faith; the presentiment of a faith proper to man in his integrity, excessive only when his imperfect obedience hinders the satisfaction of his wish? Nature is transcendental, exists primarily, necessarily, ever works and advances, yet takes no thought for the morrow. :Th1an owns the dignity of the life which throbs around him, in chemistry, and tree, and animal~ and in the involuntary functions of his own body; yet he is balked when he tries to fling himself into this enchanted circle, where all is done without degradation. Yet genius and virtue predict in man the same absence of private ends and of can .. descension to circumstances, united with every trait and talent of beauty and power. This way of thinking, falling on Roman times, made Stoic philosophers; falling on despotic times, made patriot Catos and THE TRANSCENDENTALIST 9~ Bruttlses; falling on superstitious times, made prophets and apostles; on popish times, made protestants and ascetic monks, preachers of Faith against the preachers of Works; on prelatical times, made Puritans and Quakers; and falling on Unitarian and commercial times, makes the peculiar shades of Idealism which we know. It is well known to most of my audience that the Idealism of the present day acquired the name of", "of Faith against the preachers of Works; on prelatical times, made Puritans and Quakers; and falling on Unitarian and commercial times, makes the peculiar shades of Idealism which we know. It is well known to most of my audience that the Idealism of the present day acquired the name of Transcendental from the use of that term by Immanuel Kant, of Konigsberg, who replied to the skeptical philosophy of Locke, which insisted that there was nothing in the intellect which was not previously in the experience of the senses, by showing that there was a very important class of ideas or imperative forms, which did not come by experience, but through which experience was acquired; that these were intuitions of the mind itself; and he denominated them Transcendental forms. The extraordinary profoundness and precision of that nlan's thinking have given vogue to his nomenclature, in Europe and America, to that extent that what- ever belongs to the class of intuitive thought is popularly called at the present day Transcendental. Although, as we have said, there is no pure Transcendentalist, yet the tendency to respect the intuitions and to give them, at least in our creed, all authority over our experience, has deeply colored the conversation and poetry of the present day; and the history of genius and of religion in these times, though impure, and as yet not incarnated in any powerful individual, \u00b7will be the history of this tendency. It is a sign of our times, conspicuous to the coarsest observer, that many intelligent and religious persons withdraw themselves from the common labors and competitions of the market and the caucus, and betake themselves to a certain solitary and critical way of living, from which no solid fruit has yet appeared to justify their separation. They hold themselves aloof:", "coarsest observer, that many intelligent and religious persons withdraw themselves from the common labors and competitions of the market and the caucus, and betake themselves to a certain solitary and critical way of living, from which no solid fruit has yet appeared to justify their separation. They hold themselves aloof: they feel the disproportion between their faculties and the work offered them, and they prefer to ramble in the country and perish of ennui, to the degradation of such charities and such ambitions as the city can propose to them. They are striking work1 and , 94 THE TRANSCENDENTALIST I crying out for somewhat worthy to do!

The question which a wise man and a student of modern history will ask, is, what that kind is? And truly, as in ecclesiastical history we take so much pains to know what the Gnostics, what the Essenes, what the Manichees, and what the Reformers believed, it would not misbecome us to inquire neal\u00b7er home, what these companions and contemporaries of ours think and do, at least so far as these thoughts and actions appear to be not accidental and personal, but common to many, and the inevitable flower of the Tree of Time.

I They are lonely; the spirit of their writing and conversation is lonely; they repel influences; they shun general society; they incline to shut themselves in their chamber in the house, to live in the country rather than in the (own, and to find their tasks and amusements in solitude. Society, to be sure, does not like this very well; it saith, \\Vhoso goes to walk. alone, accuses the whole world; he declares all to be unfit to be his companions;\u00b7 , it is very uncivil, nay, insulting; Society will retaliate. Mean- t time, this retirement does not proceed from any whim. on the part of these separators; but if anyone will take pains to talk with them, he will find that this part is chosen both from tem- perament and from principle; with some unwillingness too, and as a choice of the less of two evils; for these persons are not by nature melancholy, sour, and unsocial-they are not stockish or brute-but joyous, susceptible, affectionate; they have even more than others a great wish to be loved. Like the young Mozart, they are rather ready to cry ten times a day, \"But are .... \"\"- THE TRANSCENDENTALIST 9S you sure you love me?\" Nay, if they tell you their whole thought, they will own that love seems to them the last and highest gift of nature; that there are persons whom in their hearts they daily thank", "ten times a day, \"But are .... \"\"- THE TRANSCENDENTALIST 9S you sure you love me?\" Nay, if they tell you their whole thought, they will own that love seems to them the last and highest gift of nature; that there are persons whom in their hearts they daily thank for existing-persons whose faces are perhaps unknown to them, but whose fame 3.nQ spirit have penetrated their soli\u00b7 tude-and for whose saF c they wish to exist.

I do not wish to be profaned. And yet, it seems as if this loneliness, and not this love, would prevail in their circumstances, because of the extravagant de- mand they make on human nature. That, indeed, constitutes a new feature in their portrait, that they are the most exacting and extortionate critics. Their quarrel with every man they meet is not with his kind, but with his degree. There is not enough of him-that is the only fault. They prolong their privilege of childhood in this wise; of doing nothing, but making immense demands on all the gladiators in the lists of action and fame They make us feel the strange disappointment which overcast~ every human youth. So many promising youths, and never I a finished man! The profound nature will have a savage rudeness; the delicate one will be shallow, or the victim of sensibility; fue THE TRANSCENDENTALIST richly accomplished will have some capital absurdity; and so every piece bas a crack. 'T is strange, but this masterpiece is the result of such an extreme delicacy that the most unobserved flaw in the boy will neutralize the most aspiring genius, and spoil the work. Talk with a seaman of the hazards to life in his profession and he will ask you, 'Where are the old sailors? Do you not see that all are young men?' And we, on this sea of human thought, in like manner inquire, Where are the old idealists? where are they who represented to the last generation that extravagant hope which a few happy aspirants suggest", "you, 'Where are the old sailors? Do you not see that all are young men?' And we, on this sea of human thought, in like manner inquire, Where are the old idealists? where are they who represented to the last generation that extravagant hope which a few happy aspirants suggest to ours? In looking at the class of counsel, and power, and wealth, and at the matronage of the land, amidst all the prudence and all the triviality, one asks, Where are they who represented genius, virtue, the invisible and heavenly wOLld, to these? Are they dead-taken in early ripeness to the gods-as ancient wis ... dam foretold their fate? Or did the high idea die out of them, and leave their unperfumed body as its tomb and tablet, an ... Douncing to all that the celestial inhabitant, who once gave them beauty, had departed? \\ViU it be better with the new generation? We easily predict a fair future to each new candi- date who enters the lists, but we are frivolous and volatile, and by low aims and ill example do what we can to defeat this hope. Then these youths bring us a rough but effectual aid. By their unconcealed dissatisfaction they expose our poverty and the in- significance of man to man. A man is a poor limitary benefactor. He ought to be a shower of benefits-a great influence, which should never let his brother go, but should refresh old merits -continually with new ones; so that though absent he should never be out of my mind, his name never far from my lips; but if the earth should open at my side, or my last hour were come, his name should be the prayer I should utter to the Universe. But in our experience, man is", "though absent he should never be out of my mind, his name never far from my lips; but if the earth should open at my side, or my last hour were come, his name should be the prayer I should utter to the Universe. But in our experience, man is cheap and friendship wants its deep sense. \\\\; e affect to dwell with our friends in their absence, but we do not; when deed, word, or letter comes not, they let us go ..

There is no compliment, no smooth speech with them; they pay you only this one compliment, of insatiable expectation; they aspire, THE TRANSCENDENTALIST 97 they severely exact, and if they only stand fast in this watch .. tO~/er, and persist in demanding unto the end, and without end, then are they terrible friends , whereof poet and priest cannot choose but stand in awe; and what if they eat clouds, and drink wind, they have not been without service to the race of man. \\Vith this passion for what is great and extraordinary, it can- not be wondered at that they are repelled by vulgarity and fri- voli ty in people. They say to thelnselves, It is better to be alone than in bad company. And it is really a wish to be met-the wish to find society for their hope and religion-which prompts them to shun what is called society. They feel that they are never so fit for friendship as ,vhen they have quitted mankind and taken themselves to friend. A picture, a book, a favorite spot in the hills or the woods which they can people with the fair and worthy creation of the fancy, can give them often forms so vivid that these for", "fit for friendship as ,vhen they have quitted mankind and taken themselves to friend. A picture, a book, a favorite spot in the hills or the woods which they can people with the fair and worthy creation of the fancy, can give them often forms so vivid that these for the time shall seem real, and society the illusion. But their solitary and fastidious manners not only withdraw them from the conversation, but from the labors of the world; they are not good citizens, not good members of society; unwill .. ingly they bear their part of the public and private burdens; they do not willingly share in the public charities, in the public religious rites, in the enterprises of education, of missions foreign and domestic, in the abolition of the slave-trade, or in the tern ... perance society. They do not even like to vote. The philan- . thropists inquire whether Transcendentalism does not mean sloth: they had as lief hear that their friend is dead, as that he is a Transcendentalist; for then is he paralyzed, and can never do anything for humanity. What right, cries the good world, has the man of genius to retreat from work, and indulge him- self? The popular literary creed seems to be, 'I am a sublime genius; I ought not therefore to labor.' But genius is the power to labor better and more availably. Deserve thy genius: exalt it ..

On the part of these children it is replied that life and their faculty seem to them gifts too rich to be squandered on such trifles as you propose to them. What you call your fundamental institutions, your great and holy causes, seem to them great abuses, and, when nearly seen, paltry matters. Each 'cause' as it is called-say Abolition, Temperance, say Calvinism, or Uni- tarianism-becomes speedily a little shop, where the article, let it have been at first never so subtle and ethereal, is now made up into portable and convenient cakes, and retailed in small quantities to suit purchasers. You make very free use of these words 'great' and 'holy,' but few things appear to them such .. Few persons have any magnificence of nature to inspire enthu- siasm, and the philanthropies and charities have a certain air of quackery. As to the general course of living, and the daily employments of men, they cannot see much virtue in these, since they are parts of this vicious circle; and as no great ends are answered by the men, there is nothing noble in the arts by which they are maintained.

Unless the action is necessary, unless it is adequate, I do not wish to perform it. I do not wish to do one thing but once. I do not love routine. Once possessed of the principle, it is equally easy to make four or forty thousand applications of it. A great man will be content to have indicated in any the slightest man- ner his perception of the reigning Idea of his time, and will leave to those who like it the mUltiplication of examples. When he bas bit the white, the rest may shatter the target. Every thing admonishes us how needlessly long life is. Every moment of a hero so raises and cheers us that a twelvemonth is an age. All that the brave Xanthus brings home from his wars is the THE TRANSCENDENTALIST 99 recollection that at the storming of Samos, \"in the heat of the battle, Pericles sn1i1ed on me, and passed on to another detach- ment.\" It is the quality of the n1oment, not the number of days, of events, or of actors, but imports. New, we confess, and by no means happy, is our condition: if you want the aid of our labor, we ourselves stand in greater want of the labor. We are miserable with inaction. We perish of rest and rust: but we do not like your work. 'Then,' says the world, 'show me your own.' 'We have", "means happy, is our condition: if you want the aid of our labor, we ourselves stand in greater want of the labor. We are miserable with inaction. We perish of rest and rust: but we do not like your work. 'Then,' says the world, 'show me your own.' 'We have none.' 'What will you do, then?' cries the world. 'We will wait.' 'How long?' 'Until the Universe beckons and calls us to work.' 'But whilst you wait, you grow old and useless.' 'Be it so: I can sit in a corner and perish (as you call it), but I will not move until I have the highest command. If no call should come for years, for centuries, then I know that the want of the Universe is the attestation of faith by my abstinence. Your virtuous projects, so called, do not cheer me. I know that which shall come will cheer me. If I cannot work, at least I need not lie. All that is clearly due today is not to lie. In other places other men have encountered sharp trials, and have be- haved themselves well. The martyrs were sawn asunder, or hung alive on meat-hooks. Cannot we screw our courage to patience and truth, and without complaint, or even with good-humor, a'V',ait our turn of action in the Infinite Counsels?' But to conle a little closer to the secret of these persons, we must say that to them it seems a very easy matter to answer the objections of the man of the world, but not so easy to dis .. pose of the doubts and objections that occur to themselves.

God knoweth- and made me aware that I had played the fool wi~h fools all this time, but that law existed for me and for all; that to me belonged trust, a child's trust and obedience, and the worship of ideas, and I should never be fool more. Well, in the space of an hour probably, I was let down from this height; I was at myoId tricks, the selfish member of a selfish society. My life is superficial, takes no root in the deep world; I ask, When shall I die and be relieved of the responsibility of seeing a Universe I do not use? I wish to exchange this flash-of-lightning faith for continuous daylight, this fever-glow for a benign climate. These two states of thought diverge every moment, and stand in wild contrast.

That is to be done which he has not skill to do, or to be said which others can say better, and he lies by, or occupies his hands with some plaything, until his hour comes again. l\\1uch of our reading, much of our labor, seems mere waiting; it was not that we were born for. Any other could do it as well or better. So little , skill enters into these works, so little do they mix with the divine life, that it really signifies little what we do, whether we tum a grindstone, or ride, or run, or make fortunes, or govern the state. The worst feature of this double consciousness is, that the two lives, of the understanding and of the soul, which we lead, really show very little relation to each other; never meet and measure each other: one prevails now, all buzz and din; and the other prevails then, all infinitude and paradise; and, with the progress of life, the two discover no greater dis- position to reconcile themselves. Yet, what is my faith? What am I? ,\\Vhat but a thought of serenity and independence, an abode in the deep blue sky? Presently the clouds shut down again; yet we retain the belief that this pretty web we weave will at last be overshot and reticulated with veins of the blue, and that the moments will characterize the days.

But this class are not sufficiently characterized if we omit to add that they are lovers and worshippers of Beauty. In the eternal trinity of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty, each in its perfection including the three, they prefer to make Beauty the sign and head. Something of the same taste is observable in all the moral movelnents of the time, in the religious and benevo- lent enterprises. They have a liberal, even an resthetic spirit. A reference to Beauty in action sounds, to be sure, a little hol- low and ridiculous in the ears of the old church. In politics, it has often sufficed, when they treated of justice, if they kept the bounds of selfish calculation. If they granted restitution, it was prudence which granted it. But the justice which is now claimed for the black, and the pauper, and the drunkard, is for Beauty- is for a necessity to the soul of the agent, not of the beneficiary. I say this is the tendency, not yet the realization. Our virtue totters and trips, does not yet walk firmly.

Yet we are tempted to smile, and we flee from the working to the speculative reformer, to escape that same slight ridicule. Alas for these days of derision and criticism! We call the Beautiful the highest, because it appears to us the golden mean, escaping the dowdiness of the good and the heartlessness of the true. They are lovers of nature also, and find an indemnity in the inviolable order of the world for the violated order and grace of man .. There is, no doubt, a great deal of well-founded objection to be spoken or felt against the sayings and doings of this class, some of whose traits we have selected; 110 doubt they will lay themselves open to criticism and to lampoons, and as ridiculous stories will be to be told of them as of any ..

IN THE history of the Church no subject has been more fruitful of controversy than the Lord's Supper. There never has been any unanimity .in the understanding of its nature, nor any uni ... formity in the mode of celebrating it. Without considering the frivolous questions which have been lately debated as to the posture in which men should partake of it; whether mixed or unmixed wine should be served; whether leavened or unleav- ened bread should be broken; the questions have been settled difierently in every church, who should be admitted to the feast, and how often it should be prepared. In the Catholic Church1 infants were at one time permitted and then forbidden to par~ take; and since the ninth century the laity receive the bread only, the cup being reserved to the priesthood. So, as to the time of the solemnity. In the Fourth Lateran Council, it was decreed that any believer should communicate at least once in a year-at Easter. Afterwards it was determined that this Sacra- ment should be received three times in the year-at Easter, Whitsuntide and Christmas. But more important controversies have arisen respecting its nature. The famous question of the Real Presence was the main controversy between the Church of England and the Church of Rome. The doctrine of the Con- substantiation taught by Luther was denied by Calvin.

And finally, it is now near two hundred years 107 108 THE LOR D'S SUP PER since the Society of Quakers denied the authority of the rite altogether, and gave good reasons for disusing it. I allude to these facts only to show that, so far from the Supper being a tradition in which men are fully agreed, there has always been the widest room for difference of opinion up'on this particular. Having recently given particular attention to this subject, I was led to the conclusion that Jesus did not intend to establish an institution for perpetual observance when he ate the Passover with his disciples; and further, to the opinion that it is not expedient to celebrate it as we do. I shall now endeavor to state distinctly my reasons for these two . . opInIons. I. The authority of the rite. An account of the Last Supper of Christ with his disciples is given by the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John~ In St. l\\latthew's Gospel (Matt. x..~vi. 26-30) are recorded the words of Jesus in giving bread and wine on that occasion to his disciples, but no expression occurs intimating that this feast was hereafter to be commemorated. In St. Mark (Mark xiv. 22-25) the same words are recorded, and still with no inti- mation that the occasion was to be remembered. St. Luke (Luke x..\"{ii. 19), after relating the breaking of the bread, has these", "no expression occurs intimating that this feast was hereafter to be commemorated. In St. Mark (Mark xiv. 22-25) the same words are recorded, and still with no inti- mation that the occasion was to be remembered. St. Luke (Luke x..\"{ii. 19), after relating the breaking of the bread, has these words: \"This do in remembrance of me.\" In St. John, although other occurrences of the same evening are related, this whole transaction is passed over without notice. Now observe the facts. Two of the Evangelists, namely, Matthew and John, were of the twelve disciples, and were present on that occasion. Neither of them drops the slightest intimation of any intention on the part of Jesus to set up any- thing permanent. John especially, the beloved disciple, who has recorded with minuteness the conversation and the transactions of that memorable evening, has quite omitted such a notice. Neither does it appear to have come to the knowledge of Mark, who, though not an eye-witness, relates the other facts. This material fact, that the occasion was to be remembered, is found in Luke alone, who was not present. There is no reason, how .. ever, that we know, for rejecting the account of Luke. I doubt THE LORD'S SUPPER 109 not, the expression was used by Jesus. I shall presently con .. sider its meaning. I have only brought these accounts together, that you may judge whether it is likely that a solemn institu- tion, to be continued to the end of time by all mankind, as they should come, nation after nation, within the inrluence of the Christian religion, would have been established in this slight manner-in a manner so slight, that the intention of cOlnmem .... orating it should not appear, from their narrative, to have caught the ear or", "time by all mankind, as they should come, nation after nation, within the inrluence of the Christian religion, would have been established in this slight manner-in a manner so slight, that the intention of cOlnmem .... orating it should not appear, from their narrative, to have caught the ear or dwelt in the mind of the only two among the twelve who wrote down what happened. Still we must suppose that the expression, \"This do in re ... membrance of me/' had COl1le to the ear of Luke from some disciple who was present. What did it really signify? It is a pro~ phetic and an affectionate expression. Jesus is a Jew, sitting with his countrymen, celebrating their national feast. He thinks of his own impending death, and wishes the minds of his dis- ciples to be prepared for it. cLWhen hereafter,\" he says to them, \"you shall keep the Passover, it will have an altered aspect to your eyes. It is now a historical covenant of God with the Jewish nation. Hereafter it will remind you of a new covenant sealed with my blood. In years to come, as long as your people shall come up to Jerusalem to keep this feast, the connection which has subsisted between us will give a new meanirn.g in your eyes to the national festival, as the anniversary of my death.\" I see natural feeling and beauty in the use of such language from Jesus, a friend to his friends; I can readily imagine that he was willing and desirous, when his disciples met, his memory should hallow their intercourse; but I cannot bring myself to believe that in the use of such an expression be looked beyond the living generation, beyond the abolition of the festival he was celebrating, and the scattering", "imagine that he was willing and desirous, when his disciples met, his memory should hallow their intercourse; but I cannot bring myself to believe that in the use of such an expression be looked beyond the living generation, beyond the abolition of the festival he was celebrating, and the scattering of the nation, and meant to' impose a memorial feast upon the whole world. Without presulning to fix precisely the purpose in the mind of Jesus, you will see that many opinions may be entertained of his intention, all consistent with the opinion that he did not design a perpetual ordinance. He may have foreseen that his disciples '\\vould meet to remember him, and that with good effect 110 THE LORD'S SUPPER It may have crossed his mind that this would be easily con ... tinued a hundred or a thousand years-as men more easily transmit a form than a virtue-and yet have been altogether out of his purpose to fasten it upon men in all times and all countries. But though the words, \"Do this in remembrance of me,\" do not occur in Matthew, l\\fark or John, and although it should be granted us that, taken alone, they do not necessarily import so much as is usually thought, yet many persons are apt to imagine that the very striking and personal manner in which the eating and drinking is described, indicates a strikiug and formal purpose to found a festival. And I admit that this im .. pression might probably be left upon the mind of one who read only the passages under consideration in the New Testa .. ment. But this impression is removed by reading any narrative of the mode in which the ancient or the modern Jews have kept the Passover. It is then perceived that", "probably be left upon the mind of one who read only the passages under consideration in the New Testa .. ment. But this impression is removed by reading any narrative of the mode in which the ancient or the modern Jews have kept the Passover. It is then perceived that the leading cir- cumstances in the Gospels are only a faithful account of that ceremony .. Jesus did not celebrate the Passover, and afterwards the Supper, but the Supper was the Passover. He did with his disciples exactly what every master of a family in Jerusalem was doing at the same hour with his household. It appears that the Jews ate the lamb and the unleavened bread and drank wine after a prescribed manner. It was the custom for the master of the feast to break the bread and to bless it, using this formula, which the Talmudists have preserved to us, \"Blessed be Thou, o Lord, our God, who givest us the fruit of the vine\"-and then to give the cup to all. Among the modern Jews, who in their dispersion retain the Passover, a hymn is also sung after this ceremony, specifying the twelve great works done by God for the deliverance of their fathers out of Egypt. But still it may be asked, Why did Jesus make expressions so extraordinary and emphatic as these-\"This is my body which is broken for you .. Take; eat. This is my blood which is shed for you. Drink it\" ?-I reply they are not extraordinary expres- sions from him. They were familiar in his mouth. He always t.aught by parables and symbols. It was the national way of THE LORD'S SUPPER III teaching, and was largely used by him.

He instructed the womal1 of Samaria respecting living water. He permitted himself to be anointed, declaring that it was for his interment. He washed the feet of his disciples. These are admitted to be symbolical actions and expressions. Here, in like manner, he calls the bread his body, and bids the disciples eat. He had used the same expression repeatedly before. The reason why St. John does not repeat his words on this occasion seems to be that he had reported a similar discourse of Jesus to the people of Capernaum more at length already (J abn vi. 27-60). He there tells the Jews, \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.\" And when the Jews on that occasion complained that they did not comprehend what he meant, he added for their better uncierstanding, and as if for our understanding, that we might not think his body was to be actually eaten, that he only meant we should live by his commandment. He closed his discourse with these explanatory expressions: \"The flesh profiteth nothing; the words that J speak to you, they are spirit and they are life.\" Whilst I am upon this topic, I cannot help remarking that it is not a little singular that we should have preserved this rite and insisted upon perpetuating one symbolical act of Christ", "flesh profiteth nothing; the words that J speak to you, they are spirit and they are life.\" Whilst I am upon this topic, I cannot help remarking that it is not a little singular that we should have preserved this rite and insisted upon perpetuating one symbolical act of Christ \u00b7~hilst we have totally neglected all others-particularly one other which had at least an equal claim to our observance. Jesus washed the feet of his disciples and\u00b7 told them that, as he had washed their feet, they ought to wash one another's feet; for he had given them an example, that they should do as he had done to them. I ask any person who believes the Supper to have been designed by Jesus to be commemorated forever, to go and read the account of it in the other Gospels, and ther. compare with it the account of this transaction in St. John, and tell me if this be not much more explicitly authorized than the Supper. It only differs in this, that we have found the Supper usp,d in New England and the washing of the feet not.. But if \u2022 112 THE LORD'S SUPPER we had found it an established rite in our churches, on grounds of mere authority, it would have been impossible to have argued against it. That rite is used by the Church of Rome, and by the SaBdemanians. It has been very properly dropped by other Christians. Why? For two reasor...s: (I) because it was a local custom, and unsuitable in western countries; and (2) because it was typical, and all understood that humility is the thing signified.

But the Passover was local too, and does not concern us, and its bread and wine were typical, and do not help us to understand the redemption which they signified. These views of the original account of the Lord's Supper lead me to esteem it an occasion full of solemn and prophetic interest, but never intended by Jesus to be the foundation of a perpetual insti- tution. . It appears, however, in Christian history that the disciples :had very early taken advantage of these impressive words of Christ to hold religious meetings, where they broke bread and drank wine as symbols. I look upon this fact as very natural in the circumstances of the Church. The disciples lived to- gether; they threw all their property into a common stock; they were bound together by the memory of Christ, and nothing could be more natural than that this eventful evening should be affectionately remembered by them; that they, Jews like Jesus, should adopt his expressions and his types, and further- more, that what was done with peculiar propriety by them, his personal friends, with less propriety should come to be extended to their companions also. In this way religious feasts grew up among the early Christians. They were readily adopted b)l the Jewish converts, who were familiar with religious feasts, and also by the Pagan converts, whose idolatrous worship had been made up of sacred festivals, and who very readily abused these to gross riot, as appears from the censures of St. Paul.

Many persons consider this fact, the observance of such a memorial !east by the early disciples, decisive of the question whether it ought to be observed by us. There was good reason for his personal friends to remember their friend and repeat his words. It was only too probable that among the half-converted Pagan\u00a3 THE LORD'S SUPPER 113 and Jews, any rite, any form, would find favor, whilst yet unable to comprehend the spiritual character of Christianity. The circumstance, however, that St. Paul adopts these views, has seemed to many persons conch.~sive in favor of the institu- tion. I am of opinion that it is wholly upon the Epistle to the Corinthians, and not upon the Gospels, that the ordinance stands .. Upon this matter of St. Paul's view of the Supper, a few important considerations must be stated. The end which he has in view, in the ele\"irenth chapter of the first Epistle, is not to enjoin upon his friends to observe the Supper, but to censure their abuse of it. We quote the pas ... sage nowadays as if it enjoined attendance upon the Supper; but he wrote it merely to chide them for drunkenness. To make their enornlity plainer, he goes back to the origin of this religious feast to show what sort of feast that was, out of which this riot of theirs came, and so relates the transactions of the Last Supper. \"1 have received of the Lord,\" he says, \"that which I delivered to YOu.\" By this expression it is often thought that a miraculous communication is implied; but certainly without good reason, if it is remembered that", "riot of theirs came, and so relates the transactions of the Last Supper. \"1 have received of the Lord,\" he says, \"that which I delivered to YOu.\" By this expression it is often thought that a miraculous communication is implied; but certainly without good reason, if it is remembered that St. Paul was living in the lifetime of all the apostles who could give him an account of the transaction; and it is contrary to all reason to suppose that God should work a miracle to convey information that could so easily be got by natural means. So that the import of the expression is that he had received the story of an eye .. witness such as we also possess. But there is a material circumstance which diminishes our confidence in the correctness of the Apostle's view; and that is, the observation that his mind had not escaped the prevalent error of the primitive Church, the belief, namely, that the second c0111ing of Christ would shortly occur, until which time~ he tells them, this feast was to be kept. Elsewhere he tells them that at that time the world would be burnt up with fire, and a new governnlent established, in which the Saints would sit on thrones; so slow were the disciples, during the life and after the ascension of Christ, to receive the idea which we receive, that his second coming was a spiritual kingdom, the dominion ,[14 THE LOR DiS SUP PER of his religion in the hearts of men, to be extended gradually over the whole world. In this manner we may see clearly enough how this ancient ordinance got its footing among the early Christians, and this single expectation of a speedy reappear- ance of a temporal Messiah, which kept its influence even over", "the hearts of men, to be extended gradually over the whole world. In this manner we may see clearly enough how this ancient ordinance got its footing among the early Christians, and this single expectation of a speedy reappear- ance of a temporal Messiah, which kept its influence even over so spiritual a man as St. Paul, would naturally tend to preserve the use of the rite when once established .. We arrive, then, at this conclusion: first, that it does not appear, from a careful examination of the account of the Last Supper in the Evangelists, that it was designed by Jesus to be perpetual; secondly, that it does not appear that the opinion of St. Paul, all things considered, ought to alter our opinion derived from the Evangelists. One general remark before quitting this branch of this sub- ject. We ought to be cautious in taking even the best ascertained opinions and practices of the primitive Church for our own. If it could be satisfactorily shown that they esteemed it authorized and to be transmitted forever, that does not settle the question lor us. \\\\T e know how inveterately they were attached to their Jewish prejudices, and how often even the influence of Christ failed to enlarge their views. On every other subject succeeding times have learned to form a judgment more in accordance with the spirit of Christianity than was the practice of the early ages. II. But it is said: \"Admit that the rite was not designed to be perpetual.. What harm doth it? Here it stands, generally accepted, under some form, by the Christian world, the un- doubted occasion of much good; is it not better it should re- main?\" This is the question of expediency. I proceed to state a few objections that in", "designed to be perpetual.. What harm doth it?

I proceed to state a few objections that in my judgment lie against its use in its present form .. I. If the view which I have taken of the history of the in- stitution be correct, then the claim of authority should be dropped in administering it. You say, every time you celebrate the rite, that Jesus enjoined it; and the whole language you use conveys that impression. But if you read the New Testa .. ment as I do, you do not believe he did. THE LORD'S SUPPER 115 2. It has seemed to me that the use of this ordinance tends to produce confusion in our views of the relation of the soul to God. It is the old objection to the doctrine of the Trinity- that the true worship was transferred from God to Christ, or that such confusion was introduced into the soul that an un- divided worship was given nowhere. Is not that the effect of the Lord's Supper? I appeal now to the convictions of com- municants, and ask such persons whether they have not been occasionally conscious of a painful confusion of thought be- tween the worship due to God and the commemoration due to Christ. For the service does not stand upon the basis of a volun- tary act, but is imposed by authority. It is an expression of gratitude to Christ, enjoined by Christ. There is an endeavor to keep Jesus in mind, whilst yet the prayers are addressed to God. I fear it is the effect of this", "stand upon the basis of a volun- tary act, but is imposed by authority. It is an expression of gratitude to Christ, enjoined by Christ. There is an endeavor to keep Jesus in mind, whilst yet the prayers are addressed to God. I fear it is the effect of this ordinance to clothe Jesus with an authority which he never claimed and which distracts the mind of the worshipper. I know our opinions differ much re- specting the nature and offices of Christ, and the degree of ven- eration to which he is entitled. I am so much a Unitarian as this: that I believe the human mind can admit but one God) and that every effort to pay religious homage to more than one being goes to take away all right ideas. I appeal, brethren, to your individual experience. In the moment when you make the least petition to God, though it be but a silent wish that he may approve you, or add one moment to your life-do you not, in the very act, necessarily exclude all other beings from your thought? In that act, the soul stands alone with God, and Jesus is no more present to your mind than your brother or your child. But is not Jesus called in Scripture the l\\1ediator? He is the mediator in that only sense in which possibly, any being can mediate between God and man-that is, an instructor of man. He teaches us how to become like God. And a true disciple of Jesus will receive the light he gives most thankfully; but the thanks he offers, and which an exalted being will accept, are 'Dot compliments, conlmemorations, but the use of that in ..

Jtruction. 116 THE LORD'S SUPPER 3. Passing other objections, I come to this, that the use of the elements, however suitable to the people and the modes of thought in the East, where it originated, is foreign and unsuited to affect us. Whatever long usage and strong association may have done in some individuals to deaden this repulsion, I appre- hend that their use is rather tolerated than loved by any of us. We are not accustomed to eAlJress our thoughts or emotions by symbolical actions. ]\\1ost men find the bread and wine no aid to devotion, and to SOlne it is a painful impediment. To eat bread is one thing; to love the precepts of Christ and resolve to obey them is quite another. The statement of this objection leads me to say that I think this difficulty, wherever it is felt, to be entitled to the greatest weight. It is alone a sufficient objection to the ordinance. It is my own objection. This mode of commemorating Christ is not suitable to me. That is reason enough why I should abandon it. If I believed it was enjoined by Jesus on his disciples, and that he even contemplated making permanent this mode of com- memoration, every way agreeable to an Eastern mind, and yet on trial it was disagreeable to my own feelings, I should not adopt it. I should choose other ways which, as more effectual upon me, he would approve more. For I choose that my re- membrances of him should be pleasing, affecting, religious.

I will love him as a glorified friend, after the free way of friend- ship, and not pay him a stiff sign of respect, as men do those whom they fear. A passage read from his discourses, a moving provocation to works like his, any act or meeting which tends to awaken a pure thought, a flow of love, an original design of virtue, I call a worthy, a true commemoration. 4- The importance ascribed to this particular ordinance is not consistent with the spirit of Christianity. The general object and effect of the ordinance is unexceptionable. It has been, and is, I doubt not, the occasion of indefinite good; but an impor- tance is given by Christians to it which never can belong to any iorm.l\\1y friends, the Apostle well assures us that \"the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, ant:'\"\" joy in the Holy Ghost.\" I am not so foolish as to declaim against' THE LORD'S SUPPER 1I7 forms. Forn1s are as essential as bodies; but to exalt particular lorn1s, to adhere to one form a moment after it is outgrown, is unreasonable, and it is alien to the spirit of Christ.

What I revere and obey in it is its reality, its boundless charity, its deep interior life, the rest it gives to mind, the echo it returns to my thoughts, the perfect accord it makes with my reason through all its representation of God and His Providence; and the persua.sion and courage that come out thence to lead me upward and onward. Freedom is the essence of this faith. It has for its object sinlply to make men good and wise. Its institutions then !-Ihoultl be as flexible as the wants of men. 1\"'hat fonn out of which the life and suitableness have departed should be as wort.hless in its eyes as the dead leaves that are falling around us. And therefore, although for the satisfaction of others I have labored to show by the history that this rite was not intended to be perpetual; although I have gone back to weigh the ex- pres5ionR of Paul, T feel that here is the true point of view.

In the midst of c()nsicl(~ratiolls as to what Paul thought, and why he so thought, I cannot help feeling that it is time misspent to argue to or fronl his convictions, or those of Luke and John, respecting any forln. I seem to lose the substance in seeking the shadow. 'rhat for which l)aul lived and died so gloriously; that for vvhich JCSl1~ gave himse1f to be crucified; the end that. anitllatec1 the thousand Inartyrs and heroes who have followed hi~1 steps, was to redeem us from a formal religion, and teach us 118 THE LORD'S SUPPER to seek our well-being in the formation of the soul. The whole world was full of idols and ordinances. The Jewish was a religion of forms; it was all body, it had no life, and the Almighty God was pleased to qualify and send forth a man to teach men that they must serve him with the heart; that only that life was religious which was thoroughly good; that sacrifice was smoke, and forms were shadows. This man lived and died true to this purpose; and now, with his blessed word and life btfore us, Chris- tians must contend that it is a matter of vital importance-really a duty, to commemorate him by a certain form, whether that form be agreeable to their understandings or not. Is not this to make vain the gift of God? Is not this to turn back the hand on the dial? Is not this to make men-to make ourselves-forget that not forms, but duties; not names,", "by a certain form, whether that form be agreeable to their understandings or not. Is not this to make vain the gift of God? Is not this to turn back the hand on the dial? Is not this to make men-to make ourselves-forget that not forms, but duties; not names, but righteousness and ~qve are enjoined; and that in the eye of God there is no other measure of the value of anyone form than the measure of its use? There remain some practical objections to the ordinance, into which I shall not now enter. There is one on which I had in- tended to say a few words; I mean the unfavorable relation in which it places that numerous class of persons who abstain from it merely from disinclination to the rite. Influenced by these considerations, I have proposed to the brethren of the Church to drop the use of the elements and the claim of authority in the administration of this ordinance, and have suggested a mode in which a meeting for the same purpose might be held, free of objection. My brethren have considered my views with patience and candor, and have recommended, unanimously, an adherence to the present form. I have therefore been t:ompelle j to consider whether it becomes me to administer it. I am clearly of opinion I ought not. This discourse has already been so far extended that I can only say that the reason of my determination is shortly this: It is my desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing which I cannot do with my whole heart. Having said this, I have said all. I have no hostility to this institution; I am only stating my want of sympathy with it. Neither should THE LORD'S SUPPER 1I9", "my desire, in the office of a Christian minister, to do nothing which I cannot do with my whole heart. Having said this, I have said all.

That is the end of my opposition, that I am not interested in it. I am content that it stands to the end of the world, if it please men and please Heaven, and I shall rejoice in all the good it produces. As it is the prevailing opinion and feeling in our religious conlffiunity that it is an indispensable part of the pastoral office to adluinister this ordinance, I am about to resign into your hands that office which you have confided to me. It has many duties for which I am feebly qualified. It has some which it will always be my delight to discharge according to my ability, wherever I exist. And whilst the recollection of its claims op' presses me with a sense of my unworthiness, I am consoled by the hope that no time and no change can deprive me of the satis 4 faction of pursuing and exercising its highest functions.

' I am owner of the sphere, Of the seven stars and the solar year, Of Cresar's hand, and Plato's brain, Of Lord Christ's heart, and Shakspeare's strain. THERE is one nlind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once. admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent. Of the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is illustrated by the entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing less than all his history. Without hurry, without rest, the human spiri t goes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every thought, every emotion which belongs to it, ill appropriate events. But the thought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history preexist in the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances predominant1 and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time. A man is the whole ency .. clopredia of facts.

A man is the whole ency .. clopredia of facts. The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie folded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp, king- dom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his manifold spirit to the manifold world. This human nlind wrote history, and this must read it. The Sphinx must solve her own riddle. If the whole of history is ip 123 I24 HISTORY one nlan, it is all to be explained from individual experience. \"There is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred nlillions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages and the ages explained by the hours. Of the universal mind each individual man is one more incarnation. All its properties consist in him .. Each new fact in bis private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men have done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises. Every revolution was first a thought in one man's mind, and when the same thought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era. Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again it will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be tredible or intelligible. vVe, as we read,", "man, it is the key to that era. Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again it will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be tredible or intelligible. vVe, as we read, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner; must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or W~ shall learn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or Cresar Borgia is as much an illustration of the mind's powers and depravations as what has befallen us. Each new law and political movement has a meaning for you. Stand before each of its tablets and say, 'Under this mask did my Proteus nature hide itself.' This rem .. edies the defect of our too great nearness to ourselves. This throws our actions into perspective-and as crabs, goats, scor- pions, the balance and the waterpot lose their meanness when hung as signs in the zodiac, so I can see my own vices without heat in the distant persons of Solomon~ Alcibiades, and Catiline. It is the universal nature which gives worth to particular men and things. Human life, as containing this, is mysterious and inviolable, and we hedge it round with penalties and laws. All laws derive hence their ultimate reason; all express more or less distinctly some command of this supreme, illimitable essence. Property also holds of the soul, covers great spiritual facts, and instinctively we at first hold to it with swords and laws and wide ~d complex combinations.

The obscure consciousness of this ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 125 fact is the light of all our day, the claim of claims; the plea for education, for justice, for charity; the foundation of friendship and love and of the heroism and grandeur which belona to acts of self-reliance. It is remarkable that involuntarily we always read as superior beings. Universal history, the poets, the romancers do not in their stateliest pictures-in the sacerdotal, the imperial palaces, in the triun1phs of will or of genius--anywhere lose our ear, anywhere make us feel that we intrude, that this is for better nlen; but rather is it true that in their grandest strokes we feel most at home. All that Shakspeare says of the king, yonder slip of a boy that reads in the corner feels to be true of himself. We sympathize in the great moments of history, in the great discov ... eries, the great resistances, the great prosperities of men; because there law was enacted, the sea was searched, the land was found, or the blow was struck, for us, as we ourselves in that place would have done or applauded. We have the same interest in condition and character. We honor the rich because they have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we feel to be proper to man, proper to us. So all that is said of the wise man by Stoic or Oriental or modern essayist, describes to each reader his own idea, describes his unattained but attainable self. All literature writes the character of the wise n1an. Books, monuments, pictures, conversation, are portraits in which he finds the lineaments he is forming.

All literature writes the character of the wise n1an. Books, monuments, pictures, conversation, are portraits in which he finds the lineaments he is forming. The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost him, and he is stimulated wherever he moves, as by personal allusions. A true aspirant therefore never needs look for allusions personal and laudatory in discourse. He hears the commendation, not of himself, but, more sweet, of that character he seeks, in every word that is said: concerning character, yea further in every fact and circumstance -in the running river and the rustling corn. Praise is looked\" homage tendered, love flows, from mute nature, from the moun- tain~ and the lights of the firmament. These hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night, let us use in broad day. 1\"he student is to read history actively and not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary. Thus compelled, the Muse of history will utter 126 HISTORY ()racles, as never to those who do not respect themselves. I have no expectation that any man will read history aright who thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men whose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense than what be is doing to-day. . The world exists for the education of eRch man. There is no age or state of society or mode of action in history to which there is not somewhat corresponding in his life.

Every thing tends in a w'Onderful manner to abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him. He should see that he can live all history in his own person. He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know that he is greater thiill all the geography and all the government of the world; he must transfer the point of view from which history is commonly read; from Rome and Athens and London, to himself, and not deny his conviction that he is the court, and if Eng12U1d or Egypt have anything to say to him he will try the case; if not, let them forever be silent. He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield their secret Bense, and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct of the mind, the purpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the signal narrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts. No anchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact. Babylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome are passing already into fiction. The Garden of Eden, the sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations. Who cares what the fact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven an immortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go the same way. \"'\u00a5hat is history,\" said Napoleon, \"but a fable agreed upon?\" This life of ours is stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War, Colonization, Church, Court and Commerce, as with so many flowers and wild ornaments grave and gay.

I will not make more account of them. I believe in Eternity. I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain and the Islands- the genius and creative principle of each and of aU eras, in my own mind.. l4/ We are always coming up with the emphatic facts of history ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 121 in our private experience and verifying them here. All history becomes subjective; in other words there is properly no history, only biography. Every mind must know the whole lesson for itself-must go over the whole ground. What it does not see, what it does not live, it will not know. What the former age has epitomized into a formula or rule for manipular convenience, it will lose all the good of verifying for itself, by means of the wall of that rule. Somewhere, sometime, it will demand and find compensation for that loss, by doing the work itself. Ferguson discovered many things in astronomy which had long been known. The better for him. History must be this or it is nothing. Every law which the state enacts indicates a fact in human nature; that is all. We must in ourselves see the necessary reason of every fact- see how it could and must be. So stand before every public and private work; before an oration of Burke, before a victory of Napoleon, before a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of Sidney, of Marmaduke Robinson; before a French Reign of Terror, and a Salem hanging of witches; before a fanatic Revival and the Animal", "be.

We assume- that we under like influence should be alike affected, and should achieve the like; and we aim to master intellectually the steps and reach the same height or the same degradation that our fellow, our proxy has done. All inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting the Pyla-- mids, the excavated cities, Stonehenge, the Ohio Circles, Mexico, Memphis-is the desire to do away with this wild, savage, and preposterous There or Then, and introduce in its place the Here and the Now. Belzoni digs and nleasures in the mummy-pits and pyramids of Thebes until he can see the end of the dif- ference between the monstrous work and himself. When he has satisfied hin1self, in general and in detail, that it was made by stIch a person as he, so armed and so motived, and to ends to which he himself should also have worked, the problem is solved; his thought lives along the whole line of temples and sphinxes and catacombs, passes through them all with satisfaction, anr., they live again to the mind, or are now. HISTORY A Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and nut done by us. Surely it was by man, but we find it not in our man. But we apply ourselves to the history of its production.

Surely it was by man, but we find it not in our man. But we apply ourselves to the history of its production. We put ourselves into the place and state of the builder. We remember the forest-dwellers, the first temples, the adherence to the first type and the decoration of it as the wealth of the nation in- .creased; the value which is given to wood by carving led to the carving over the whole mountain of stone of a cathedral. When we have gone through this process, and added thereto the Cath- olic Church, its cross, its music, its processions, its Saints' day~ and image .. worship, we have as it were been the man that made the minster; we have seen how it could and must be. We have the sufficient reason. The difference between men is in their principle of associa .. tion. Some men classify objects by color and size and other ~ccidents of appearance; others by intrinsi~ likeness, or by the relation of cause and effect. The progress of the intellect is to the clearer vision of pauses, which neglects surface differences. To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men divine. For the eye is fastened on the life, and slights the cir .. cumstance. Every chemical substance, every plant, every animal in its growth, teaches the unity of cause, the variety of appear .. ance. Upborne and surrounded as we are by this all .. creating nature, soft and fluid as a cloud or the air, why should we be such hard pedants, and magnify a few forms?

Why should we make ac- .count of time, or of magnitude., or of figure? The soul knows them not, and genius, obeying its law, knows how to play with them as a young child plays with graybeards and in churches. Genius studies the causal thought, and far back in the womb of things sees the rays parting from one orb, that diverge, ere they fall, by infinite diameters. Genius watches the monad through all his masks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature. Genius detects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the grub, through the egg, the constant individual; through countless individuals the fixed species; through many ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 129 species the genus; through all genera the steadfast type; through all the kingdoms of organized life the eternal unity. ~J ature is a mutable cloud which is always and never the same. She casts the same thought into troops of forms, as a poet makes twenty fables with one moral. Through the bruteness and toughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will. The adamant strean1S into soft but precise form before it, and whilst I look at it its outline and texture are changed again. Nothing is so fleeting as fOl'm; yet never does it quite deny itself. In Ulan we still trace the remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of servitude in the lower races; yet in him they enhance his nobleness and grace; as 10, in Aeschylus, trans ... formed to a cow, offends the imagination; but how changed when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-]", "trace the remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of servitude in the lower races; yet in him they enhance his nobleness and grace; as 10, in Aeschylus, trans ... formed to a cow, offends the imagination; but how changed when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-] ove, a beautiful woman with nothing of the metamorphosis left but the lunar horns as the splendid ornament of her brows! The identity of history is equally intrinsic, the diversity equally ouvious. There is, at the surface, infinite variety of things; at the centre there is simplicity of cause. How many are the acts 0 f onc Inan in which we recognize the same char- acter! Observe the sources of our information in respect to the Greek genius. We have the civil history of that people, as Herodotus1 Thucydides, Xcnophon, and Plutarch have given it; a very sufficient account of what manner of persons they were and what they did. We have the salne national mind ex .. pressed for us again in their literature, in epic and lyric poems, drama, and philosophy; a very cOlnplete form. Then we have it once more ill their architecture, a beauty as of temperance itself, limited to the straight line and the square-a builded geometry. Then we have it once again in sculptu1~e, the \"tongue on the balance of expression,\" a multitude of forms in the utmost free\u00b7 dom of action and never transgressing the ideal serenity; like votaries pcrforn1ing some religious dance before the gods, and, though in convulsive pain or mortal combat, never daring to break the figure and decorum of their dance. Thus of the genius of one relnarkabJc people we have a fourfold representation: and to the senses what more unlike than an ode ,,f Pindar, a marble t30", "before the gods, and, though in convulsive pain or mortal combat, never daring to break the figure and decorum of their dance. Thus of the genius of one relnarkabJc people we have a fourfold representation: and to the senses what more unlike than an ode ,,f Pindar, a marble t30 HISTORY centaur, the peristyle of the Parthenon, and the last actions of Phocion? Everyone must have observed faces and forms which, with- out any resembling feature, make a like impression on the be- holder. A particular picture or copy of verses, if it do not awaken the same train of images, will yet superinduce the same senti- ment as some wild mountain walk, although the resemblance is nowise obvious to the senses, but is occult and out of the reach of the understanding. Nature is an endless combination and repetition of a very few laws. She hums the old well .. known air through innumerable variations. Nature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her tvorks, and delights in startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected quarters. I have seen the head of an old sachem of the forest which at once reminded the eye of a bald mountain summit, and the furrows of the brow suggested the strata of the rock .. There are men whose manners have the same essential splendor as the simple and awful sculpture on the friezes of the Parthenon and the remains of the earliest Greek art. And there are compositions ,of the same strain to be found in the books of all ages. What is Guido's Rospigliosi Aurora but a morning thought, as the horses in it are only a morning cloud?

What is Guido's Rospigliosi Aurora but a morning thought, as the horses in it are only a morning cloud? If anyone will but take pains to observe the variety of actions io which be is equally inclined in certain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse, he will see how deep is the chain of affinity. A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort becoming a tree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form merely-but by watching for a time his mo- tjons and plays, the painter enters into his nature and can then draw him at will in every attitude. So RODS \"entered into the inmost nature of a sheep.\" I knew a draughtsman employed in a public survey who found that he could not sketch the rocks until their geological structure was first explained to him. In a certain state of thought is the common origin of very diverse works. It is the spirit and not the fact that is identical. By a deeper apprehension, and not primarily by a painful acquisition ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES I3 1 of many rnanual skills, the artist attains the power of awakening other souls to a given activity. It has been said that \"common souls pay with what they do, nobler souls with that which they are.\" And why? Because a profound nature awakens in us by its actions and words, by its very looks and manners, the same power and beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses. Civil and natural history, the history of art and of literature, must be explained from individual history, or must remain words. There is nothing but is", "its actions and words, by its very looks and manners, the same power and beauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses.

There is nothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest us-kingdom, college, tree, horse, or iron shoe-the roots of all things ~re in man. Santa Croce and the Dome of St. Peter's are lame copies after a divine model. Strasburg Cathe- dral is a material counterpart of the soul of Erwin of Steinbach. The true poem is the poet's mind; the true ship is the ship- builder. In the man, could we lay him open, we should see the reason for the last flourish and tendril of bis work; as every spine and tint in the sea-shell preexists in the secreting organs of the fish. The whole of heraldry and of chivalry is in courtesy. A man of fine manners shall pronounce your name with all the ornament that titles of nobility could ever add. The trivial experience of every day is always verifying some old prediction to us and converting into things the words and signs which we had heard and seen without heed. A lady with whom I was riding in the forest said to me that the woods al\\vaY!l seemed to her to wait, as if the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer had passed onward; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet.

The man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, ha~ been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world. I remember one summer day in the fields my com ... panion pointed out to me a broad cloud, which might extend a quarter of a nlile parallel to the horizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over churches-a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate with eyes and mouth, supported on ei tIler side by wide-stretched symmetrical wings. !3 2 HISTORY What appears once in the atmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly the archetype of that familiar ornament. I have seen in the sky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed to me that the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the thunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift along the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common architectural scroll to abut a tower. By surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent anew the orders and the ornaments of architecture, as we see how each people merely decorated its primitive abodes. The Doric temple preserves the semblance of the wooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt. The Chinese pagoda is plainly a Tartar tent. The Indian and Egyptian temples still betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers. \"The cus- tom of making houses and tombs in the living rock,\" says Heeren in his Researches on the Ethiopians, \"determined very naturally the principal character of the Nubian Egyptian archi- tecture to the", "tent. The Indian and Egyptian temples still betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers. \"The cus- tom of making houses and tombs in the living rock,\" says Heeren in his Researches on the Ethiopians, \"determined very naturally the principal character of the Nubian Egyptian archi- tecture to the colossal form which it assumed. In these caverns, already prepared by nature, the eye was accustomed to dwell on huge shapes and masses, so that when art came to the assist- ance of nature it could not move on a small scale without de- grading itself. \\\\'bat would statues of the usual size, or neat porches and wings have been, associated with those gigantic halls before whic.h only Colossi could sit as watchmen or lean on the pillars of the interior?\" The Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the forest trees, with all their boughs, to a festal or solemn arcade; as the bands about the cleft pillars still indicate the green withes that tied them. No one can walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being struck with the architectural appearance of the grove, especially in winter, when the barren- ness of all other trees shows the low arch of the Saxons. In the woods in a winter afternoon one will see as readily the origin of the stained glass window, with which the Gothic cathedrals are adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen through the bare and crossing branches of the forest.

The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony in man. The mountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower, with the lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial proportions and perspective of vegetable beauty. In like manner all public f2.cts are to be individualized, all private facts are to be generalized. Then at once History becomes fluid and true, and Diography deep and sublime. As the Persian imitated in the slender shafts and capitals of his architecture the sten1 and flower of the lotus and palm, so the Persian court in its magnificent era never gave over the nomadism of its bar- barous tribes, but travelled from Ecbatana, where the spring was spent, to Susa in summer and to Babylon for the winter. In the early history of Asia and Afriica, Nomadism and Agri- culture are the two antagonist facts. The geography of Asia and of Africa necessitated a nomadic life. But the nomads were the terror of all those vvhom the soil or the advantages of a market had induced to build towns. Agriculture therefore was a religious injunction, because of the perils of the state from nomadism.

And in these late and civil countries of England and America these propenRities still fight out the old battle, in the nation and in the individual. The nomads of Africa were constrained to wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives the cattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy season and to drive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions. The nomads of Asia follow the pasturage from month to month. In America and Europe the nomadism is of trade and curiosity; a progress, certainly, from the gad-fly of Astaboras to the Anglo and Italomania of Boston Bay. Sacred cities, to which a periodi- cal religious pilgrimage was enjoined, or stringent laws and customs tending to invigorate the national bond, were the check on the old rove-rs; and the cumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the itinerancy of the present day. The 134 HISTORY :a.ntagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in individuals, a.s the love of adventure or the ~ove of repose happens to pre- dominate. A man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid domestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all latitudes as easily as a Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or in the snow, he sleeps as warm, dines with as good appetite, and associates as happily as beside his own chimneys. Or perhaps his facility is deeper seated, in the increased range of his faculties of observation, which yield him points of interest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes.

The pastoral nations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this intellectual nomad .. ism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind through the dissipation of power on a miscellany of objects. The home-keeping wit, on the other hand, is that continence or content which finds all the elements of life in its own soil; and which has its own perils of monotony and deterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infu- . Slons. Every thing the individual sees without him corresponds to his states of mind, and every thing is in turn intelligible to him, as his onward thinking leads him into the truth to which that fact or series belongs. The primeval world-the Fore-World, as the Germans say- I can dive to it in myself as well as grope for it with researching fingers in catacombs, libraries, and the broken reliefs and torsos of ruined villas. , What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history, letters, art and poetry, in all its period3 from the Heroic or Homeric age down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later? What but this, that every man passes personally through a Grecian period. The Grecian ~tate is the era of the bodily nature, the perfection of the senses- ~f the spiritual nature unfolded in strict unity with the body.

The manners of that period are plain and fierce. The reverence exhibited is for personal qualities\u00b7 CQuraae , t) , address, self-command, justice, strength, swiftness, a. loud voice, a broad chest. Luxury and elegance are not known. A sparse population and want make every man his own valet, cook, butcher and soldier, and the habit of supplying his own needs p.ducates the body to wonderful performances. Such are the Agamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far different is the picture Xenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the Retreat of the Ten Thousand. \"After the army had crossed the river Teleboas in Armenia, there fell ll1uch snow, and the troops lay miserably on the ground covered with it. But Xeno- phon arose naked, and taking an axe, began to split wood; whereupon others rose and did the like.\" Throughout his army exists a boundless liberty of speech. They quarrel for plunder, they wrangle with the generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as sharp-tongued as any and sharper-tongued than most, and so gives as good as he gets. Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys, with such a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have?

Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys, with such a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have? The costly chann of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the old literature, is that the persons speak simply-speak as persons who have great good sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective habit has become the predominant habit of the mind. Our admiralion of the antique is not admiration of the old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not reflective, but perfect in their senses and in their health, with the finest physical organi- zation in the world. Adults acted with the simplicity and grace of children. They made vases, tragedies and statues, such as healthy senses should-that is, in good taste. Such things have continued to be made in all ages, and are now, wherever a healthy physique exists; but, as a class, from their superior organization, they have surpassed all. They combine the energ~ of manhood with the engaging unconcifJusness of childhood I The attraction of these manners is -that they belong to man) HISTORY and are known to every man in virtue of his being once a child; besides that there are always individuals who retain these char- acteristics. A person of child-like genius and inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our love of the Muse of Hellas. I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes. In reading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks, mountains and waves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea. I feel the eternity of man, the idel1tity of his thought.

The Greek had, it seems, the same fellow-beings as I. The sun and moon, water and fire, met his heart precisely as they meet mine. Then the vaunted distinction between Greek and English, between Classic and Romantic schools, seems superficial and pedantic. When a thought of Plato becomes a thought to me-when a truth that fired the soul of Pindar fires mine, time is no more. When I feel that we two meet in a perception, that our two souls are tinged with the same hue, and do as it were run into one, why should I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count Egyp- tian years? The student interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of chivalry, and the days of maritime adventure and circumnavi .. gation by quite parallel miniature experiences of his own. To the sacred history of the world he has the same key. When the voice of a prophet out of the deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him a sentiment of his infancy, a prayer of his youth, he then pierces to the truth through all the confusion of tradition and the caricature of institutions. Rare, extravagant spirits come by us at intervals, who dis- close to us new facts in nature.

Hence evidently the tripod, the priest, the priestess inspired by the divine afflatus. Jesus astonishes and overpowers sensual people. They cannot unite him to history, or reconcile him with themselves. As they come to revere their intuitions and aspire to live holily, their own piety explains every fact, every word. How easily these old worships of Moses, of Zoroaster, of ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 131 Menu, of Socrates, domesticate themselves in the mind. I cannot find any antiquity in them. They are mine as much as theirs. I have seen the first monks and anchorets, without crossing seas or centuries. More than once some individual has appeared to me with such negligence of labor and such commanding con ... templation, a haughty beneficIary begging in the nalne of God .. as made good to the nineteenth century Simeon the Stylite, the Thebais, and the first Capuchins. The priestcraft of the East and West, of the Magian, Brahminr Druid, and Inca, is expounded in the individual's private life\" The cramping influence of a hard forn1alist on a young child, in repressing his spirits and courage, paralyzing the understanding, and that without producing indignation, but only fear and obedi ... ence, and even much sympathy with the tyranny-is a familiar fact, explained to the child when he becomes a man, only by seeing that the oppressor of his youth is himself a child tyran .. nized over by those nanles and words and forms of whose influ- ence he was merely the organ to the youth.

The fact teaches him how Belus was worshipped and how the Pyramids were built, better than the discovery by Champollion of the names of all the workmen and the cost of every tile. He finds Assyria and the Mounds of Cholula at his door, and hinlself has laid the courses. Again, in that protest which each considerate person makes; against the superstition of his tilnes, he repeats step for step the part of old refornlers, and in the starch after truth finds, like them, new perils to virtue. He learns again what moral vigor is needed to supply the girdle of a superstition. A great licentious- ness treads on the heels of a reformation. How many times in the history of the world has the Luther of the day had to lament the decay of piety in his own household 1 \"Doctor,\" said his wife to Martin Luther, one day, \"how is it that whilst subject to papacy we prayed so often and with such fervor, whilst now' we pray with the utn10st coldness and very seldom?\" The advancing man discovers how deep a property he has in literature-in all fable as well as in all history.

One after another be comes up in his private adventures with every fable of Aesop, of Homer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer, of Scott, and verifies them with his own head and hands. The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper creations of the imagination and not of the fancy, are universal verities. What a range of meanings and what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus! Beside its primary value as the first chapter of the history of Europe (the mythology thinly veiling authentic facts, the invention of the mechanic arts and the migration of colonies) it gives the history of religion, with some closeness to the faith of later ages. Prometheus is the Jesus of the old mythology. He is the friend of man; stands between the unjust ('justice\" of the Eternal Father and the race of mor- tals, and readily suffers all things on their account. But where it departs from the Calvinistic Christianity and exhibits him as the defier of Jove, it represents a state of mind which readily ap- pears wherever the doctrine of Theism is taught in a crud~ objective form, and which seems the self-defence of man against this untruth, namely a discontent with the believed fact that a God exists, and a feeling that the obligation of reverence is onerous. It would steal if it could the fire of the Creator, and live apart from him and independent of him. The Prometheus Vinctus is the romance of skepticism. Not less true to all time are the details of that stately apologue. Apollo kept the flocks 9f", "of reverence is onerous.

And what see I on any side but the transmigrations of Proteus? I can symbolize my thought by using the name of any creature, of any fact, because every creature is man agent or patient. Tantalus is but a name for you and me. Tantalus means the impossibility of drinking the waters of thought which are always gleaming and waving within sight of the soul.

As near and proper to us is also that old fable of the Sphinx, who was said to sit in the road .. side and put riddles to every passenger. If the man could not answer, she swallowed him alive. If he could solve the riddle, the Sphinx was slain .. What is our life but an endless flight of winged facts or events? In splendid variety these changes come, all putting questions to the human spirit. Those men who cannot answer by a superior wisdom these facts or questions of time, serve them. Facts en- i:umber them, tyrannize over them, and make the men of routine, the men of sense, in whom a literal obedience to facts has extin ... guished every spark of that light by which man is truly man. But if the man is true to his better instincts or sentiments, and refuses the dominion of facts, as one that comes of a higher race; remains fast by the soul and sees the principle, then the facts fall aptly and supple into their places; they know their master, and the meanest of them glorifies him.

So far then are they eternal entItles, as real to~day as in the first Olympiad. Much revolving them he 140 HISTORY writes out freely his humor, and gives them body to his own imagination. And although that poem be as vague and fantastic as a dream, yet is it much more attractive than the more regular dramatic pieces of the same author, for the reason that it operates a wonderful relief to the mind from the routine of customary images-awakens the reader's invention and fancy by the wild ireedom of the design, and by the unceasing succession of brisk shocks of surprise. The universal nature, too strong for the petty nature of the bard, sits on his neck and writes through his hand; so that when he seems to vent a mere caprice and wild romance, the issue is an exact allegory. Hence Plato said that \"poets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves understand.\" All the fictions of the Middle Age explain themselves as a masked or frolic expression of that which in grave earnest the mind of that period toiled to achieve. Magic and all that is ascribed to it is a deep presentiment of the powers of science.

Magic and all that is ascribed to it is a deep presentiment of the powers of science. The shoes of swiftness, the sword of sharpness, the power of subduing the elements, of using the secret virtues of minerals, of understanding the voices of birds, are the obscure efforts of the mind in a right direction. The preternatural prowess of the hero, the gift of perpetual youth, and the like, are alike the endeavor of the human spirit \"to bend the shows of things to the desires of the mind.\" In Perceforest and Amadis de Gaul a garland and a rose bloom on the head of her who is faithful, and fade on the brow of the inconstant. In the story of the Boy and the Mantle even a mature reader may be surprised with a glow of virtuous pleas- ure at the triumph of the gentle Venelas; and indeed all the postulates of elfin annals-that the fairies do not like to be named; that their gifts are capricious and not to be trusted; that who seeks a treasure must not speak; and the like-I find true in Concord, however they might be in Cornwall or Bretagne.

Lucy Ashton is another name for fidelity, ,vhich is always beautiful and always liable to calamity in this world. But along with the civil and metaphysica.l history of man, another history goes daily forward-that of the external world-- in which he is not less strictly implicated. He is the compend of time; he is also the correlative of nature. His power consists in the multitude of his affinities, in the fact that his life is intertwined with the whole chain of organic and inorganic being .. In old Rome the public roads beginning at the Forum proceeded north, south, east, west, to the centre of every province of the empire, making each market .. town of Persia, Spain and Britain pervious to the soldiers of the capital: so out of the human heart go as it were highways to the heart of every object in nature, to reduce it under the dominion of man. A man is a bundle of relations, a knot of roots, whose flower and fruitage is the world. His faculties refer to natures out of him and predict the world he is to inhabit, as the fins of the fish foreshow that water exists, or the wings of an eagle in the egg presuppose air. He cannot live without a world. Put Napoleon in an island prison, let his faculties find no men to act on, no Alps to climb, no stake to play for, and he would beat the air, and appear stupid.

Transport him to large countries, dense population, complex interests and antagonist power, and you shall see that the man Napoleon, bounded that is by such a profile and outline, is not the virtual Napoleon. This is but Talbot's shadow- \"His substance is not here. For what you see is but the smallest part And least proportion of humanity; 'But were the whole frame here, It is of such a spacious, lofty pitch, Your roof were not sufficient to contain it.\" Columbus needs a planet to shape his course upon. Newto~ and Laplace need myriads of age and thick-strewn celestial areas. 142 HISTORY One may say a gravitating solar system is already prophesied in the nature of Newton's mind. Not less does the brain of Davy or of Gay-Lussac, from childhood exploring the affinities and repulsions of particles, anticipate the laws of organization. Does not the eye of the human embryo predict the light? the ear of Handel predict the witchcraft of harmonic sound? Do not the constructive fingers of Watt, Fulton, Whittemore, Ark- wright, predict the fusible, hard, and temperable texture of metals, the properties of stone, water, and wood? Do not the lovely attributes of the maiden child predict the refinements and decorations of civil society? Here also we are reminded of the action of man on man.

Who knows himself before he has been thrilled with indignation at an outrage, or has heard an eloquent tongue, or has shared the throb of thousands in a national ex- ultation or alarm? No man can antedate his experience, or guess what faculty or feeling a new object shall unlock, any more than he can draw to-day the face of a person whom he shall see to ... morrow for the first time. I will not now go behind the general statement to explore the reason of this correspondency. Let it suffice that in the light of these two facts, namely, that the mind is One, and that nature is its correlative, history is to be read and written. Thus in all ways does the soul concentrate and reproduce its treasures for each pupil. He too shall pass through the whole ';ycle of experience. He shall collect into a focus the rays of nature. History no longer shall be a dull book. It shall walk. incarnate in every just and wise man. You shall not tell me by languages and titles a catalogue of the volumes you have read. You shall make me feel what periods you have lived. A man shall be the Temple of Fame.

Is there somewhat overweening in this claim? Then I reject all I have written, for what is the use of pretending to know what we know not? But it is the fault of our rhetoric that we cannot strongly state one fact without seeming to belie some other. I hold our actual knowledge very cheap. Hear the rats in the wall, see the lizard on the fence, the fungus under foot, the lichen on the log. What do I know sympathetically, morally, of either of these worlds of life? As old as the Caucasian man- perhaps older-these creatures h~ve kept their counsel beside him, and there is no record of any word or sign that has passed from one to the other. What connection do the books show be- tween the fifty or sixty chemical elements and the historical eras? Nay, what does history yet record of the metaphysical annals of man?

The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does be know until he has tried.

A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out froln his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their Inerits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome.

I remember an answer which when quite young I ,vas prompted to make to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me 'With the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, \"What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within?\" my friend suggested-\"But these iInpulses may be from below, not from above.\" I replied, \"They do not seem \\ to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then ':. nom the Devil.\" No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature.

A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition as if every thing were titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitu- late to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass?

I Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There is the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world-as invalids and the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. ] cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right.

'\u00a5hat I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think\" This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and m.eanness .. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it scatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers-under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is with- drawn from your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a blind-man's-buff is this game o~ conform- ity.

Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another hand- kerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these commu- nities of opinion.

The muscles, not spontaneously moved I but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face, with the most disagreeable sensation. For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure_ And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look. askance on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. If this aversion had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad counte .. nance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows anc1 a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage oi' the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when \u00b7the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintel- ligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.

The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consist- ency; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes or others have 110 other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loth to disappoint them. But why should you k~ep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict SOnl6- what you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in SELF-RELIANCE acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your meta- physics you have denied personality to the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and fiee. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.

I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the ineqUalities of Andes and Himmal~h are insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza; read it forward, back .. ward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this pleasing contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not and see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound with ilie hum of insects. The swallow over Iny vvindow should inter- weave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment. There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem.

The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average ten- dency. Your genuine action will explain itself and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I can be firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Always scorn appearances and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagina- tion? The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed a united light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of angels.

Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me. I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you and all men and all events. Ordinarily, 154 SELF-RELIANCE every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much that he must make all circumstances indifferent.

A man Cresar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man.

It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their ~wn right and comeliness, the right of every man. The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. \\Vho is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science .. baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which\" we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this pri ... mary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the Jast fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed.

SELF-RELIANCE Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates be .. tween the voluntary acts of his mind and his involuntary per- ceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving; the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the state .. ment of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal.

If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time all mankind-although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun. The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate; not one thing, but all . things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is simple and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away- means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it--one as much as another. All things are dis- solved to their centre by their cause, and in the universal miracle petty and particular miracles disappear.

That t~10ught by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this. When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name; the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. 1t", "you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name; the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new. 1t shall exclude example and experience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There is somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with know- ing that all things go well.

But if I can discharge its debts it enables me to dispense with the popular code. If anyone imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day. And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cas~ off the common motives of humanity and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster.

Let a Stoic open the resources of man and tell ,nen they are not leaning willows, but can and nlust detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed bealing to the nations; that he should be ashamed of our com ... passion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries and customs out of the window, we pity him no more but thank and revere him; and that teacher shall lestore the life of man to splendor and make his name dear to all history.

Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent it the want of self-reliance: it is infirmity of will.

We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. \"To the perseverinJ!: mortal,\" said Zoroaster, \"the blessed Immortals are swift.\" As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect.

It will happen for a time that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind. But in all unbalanced minds the classifica- tion is idolized, passes for the end and not for a speedily ex- haustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see-how you can see; 'It must be somehow that you ~tole the light from us.' They do not yet perceive that light, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call it their own. If they are bonest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million .. colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning. 2.

But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deepet: un\u00b7 soundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. OUI minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind? Our houses are built with foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant. The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It was jn his own mind that the artist sought his model. It was an application of his OWll thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed. And why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty~ convenience, grandeur of 'thought and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the [66 SEL}'-RALIANCE people, the habit and form of the government, he will create d. house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste .and sentiment will be satisfied also.

Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can pre- sent every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Wa~hington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipion ... ism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shak- speare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul, all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs o~ one nature.

It recedes as fast on one side as it ~ains on the other. It undergoes continual changes; it is bar- barous, it is civilized, it is christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration. For every thing that is given something is taken. Society acquires new arts and loses old in- stirlCts.

He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle. He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his memory; his libraries overload hi.: wit; the insurance-office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Chris- tianity, entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue. For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian? There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk. No greater men are now than ever \"vere. A singular equality may be observed between the great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to edu- cate greater men than Plutarch's heroes, three or four ane'! twenty centuries ago.

The great genius returns to essential man. We reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked valor and disencumbering it of all aids. The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las Cases, \"without abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries and carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his hand-mill and bake his bread himself.\" Society is a wave.

Its unity is only phenomenaL The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience dies with thenl. And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance. Men have looked aw~y from themselves and at things so long that they have come to esteem the religious, learned and civil insti- tutions as guards of property, and they deprecate assaults on f:hese, because they feel them to be assaults on property. They lneasure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not ~)y what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his klroperty, out of new respect for his nature. Especially he hates what he has if he see that it is accidental-came to him by in- heritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to him, has no root in him and merely lies there because no revolution or no robber takes it away .. But that which a man is, does always by necessity acquire; and what the man acquires, is living property, which does not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or bank. ruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes. \"Thy lot or portion of life,\" said the Caliph Ali, \"is seeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.\" Our de- ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES pendence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers ..

EVER since I v,,\"as a boy I have wished to write a discourse on Com ... pensation; for it seemed to me when very young that on tbis subject life was ahead of theology and the people knew more than the preachers taught. The documents too from which the doc- trine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless varety, and lay always before me, even in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the fann and the dwelling-house; greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of character, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me also that in it might be shown men a rav \" of divinity, the present action of the soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition; and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that which be knows was always and always must be, because it really is now. It appeared moreover that if tbis doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which 170 \u2022 ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey, that would not suffer us to lose our way.

The preacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy, un ... folded in the ordinary manner the doctrine of the Last Judgment. He assumed that judgment is not executed in this world; that the wicked are successful; that the good are miserable; and then urged from reason and from Scripture a compensation to De made to both parties in the next life. No offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this doctrine. As far as I could observe when the meeting broke up they separated without remark on the sermon. Yet what was the import of this teaching? What did the preacher mean by saying that the good are miserable in the pres .. ent life? Was it that houses and lands, offices, wine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by unprincipled men, whilst the saints are poor and despised; and that a compensation is to be made to these last hereafter, by giving them the like gratifications another day- bank-stock and doubloons, venison and champagne? This must be the compensation intended; for ,\\\\\u00b0hat else? Is it that they are to have leave to pray and praise? to love and serve men? Why', that they can do now. The legitimate inference the disciple would draw was-eWe are to have such a good time as the sinners have now'; or, to push it to its extreme import-'You sin now, V'le shall sin by and by; we would sin now, if we could; not being success ... fu1 we expect our revenge to-morrow.'

The fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are suc- cessful; that justice is not done now. The blindness of the preacher consisted in deferring to the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a manly success, instead of confrontin~ and convicting the world from the truth; announcing the presence of the soul; the omnipotence of the will; and so establishing thE: standard of good and ill, of success and falsehood. I find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of tht day and the same doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally they treat the related topics .. I think that our popu- COMPENSATIO~ lar theology has gained in decorum, and not in principle, over the superstitions it has displaced. But men are better than their theology. Their daily life gives it the lie. Every ingenuous and aspiring soul leaves the doctrine behind him in his own experi- 'lence, and all men feel sometimes the falsehood which they cannot demonstrate. For men are wiser than they know. That which they hear in schools and pulpits without afterthought, if said in \u00a3onversation would probably be questioned in silence. If a man dogmatize in a mixed company on Providence and the divine laws, he is answered by a silence which conveys well enough to an observer the dissatisfaction of the hearer, but his incapacity to make his own statement.

I shall attempt in this and the following chapter to record some facts that indicate the path of the law of Compensation; happy beyond my expectation if I shall truly draw the smallest arc of tbis circle. Polarity, or action and reaction, we meet in every part of na- ture; in darkness and light; in heat and cold; in the ebb and flow .,f waters;; in male and female; in the inspiration and expiration of plants and animals; in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of the animal body; in the systole and diastole of the .heart; in the undulations of fluids and of sound; in the centrif- ugal and centripetal gravity; in electricity, galvanism, and chemical affinity. Superinduce magnetism at one end of a needle, the opposite magnetism takes place at the other end. If the south attracts, the north repels. To empty here, you must condense there. An inevitable dualism bisects nature, so that each thing is a half, and suggests another thing to make it whole; as, spirit, matter; man, woman; odd, even; subjective, objective; in, out; upper, under; motion, rest; yea, nay. \\Vhilst the world is thus dual, so is everyone of its parts. The entire system of things gets represented in every particle. There is somewhat that resembles the ebb and flow of the sea, day and night, man and woman, in a single needle of the pine, in a kernel of corn, in each individual of every animal tribe.

For example, in the animal kingdom the physiologist has observed that no creatures are favorites, but a certain compensa .. tion balances every gift and every defect. A surplusage given ta one part is paid out of a reduction from another part of the same creature. If the head and neck are enlarged, the trunk. and ex .. tremities are cut short. The theory of the mechanic forces is another example. What we gain in power is lost in time, and the converse. The periodic or compensating errors of the planets is another instance. The influences of climate and soil in political history is another. The cold climate invigorates. The barren soil does not breed fevers, crocodiles, tigers or scorpions. The same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a re- ceiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly. For every thing you have missed, you have gained something else; and for every thing you gain, you lose son1ething. If riches increase, they are increased that use them. If the gatherer gathers too much, Nature takes out of the man what she puts into his chest; swells the estate, but kills the owner. Nature hates monopolies and exceptions. The waves of the sea do not more speedily seek a level from their loftiest tossing than the varieties of condition tend to equalize themselves.

There is always some levelling circumstance that puts down the over- bearing, the strong, the rich, the fortunate, substantially on the same ground with all others. Is a man too strong and fierce for society and by temper and position a bad citizen-a morose ruf .. fian, with a dash of the pirate in him?-Nature sends him a troop of pretty sons and daughters who are getting along in the dame's classes at the village school, and love and fear for them smooths his grim scowl to courtesy., Thus she contrives to in- tenerate the granite and felspar, takes the boar out and puts the lamb in and keeps her balance true.

This law writes the laws of cities and nations. It is in vain to build or plot or combine against it. Things refuse to be mis- managed long. Res nolunt diu male administrari. Though no checks to a new evil appear) the checks exist, and will appear. If the government is cruel, the governor's life is not safe. If you tax too high, the revenue will yield nothing. If you make the criminal code sanguinary, juries will not convict. If the law is too mild, private vengeance comes in. If the government is a terrific democracy, the pressure is resisted by an over-charge of energy in the citizen, and life glows with a fiercer flame. The true life and satisfactions of man seem to elude the utmost rigors or felici- Lies of condition and to establish themselves with great indiffer- ency under all varities of circumstances. Under all governments the influence of character remains the same-in Turkey and in New England about alike.

ESSAYS: FIRST S:!RIES 175 bird as a flying man, a tree as a rooted man. Each new form re- peats not only the main character of the type, but part for part all the details, all the aims, furtherances, hindrances, energies and whole system of every other. Every occupation, trade, art, trans- action, is a compend of the world and a correlative of every other. Each one is an entire emblem of human life; of its good and ill, its trials, its enemies, its course and its end. And each one must somehow accommodate the whole man and recite all his destiny. The world globes itself in a drop of dew. TJ),e microscope can ... not find the animalcule which is less perfect for being little. Eyes, ears, taste, smell, motion, resistance, appetite, and organs of reproduction that take hold on eternity-all find room to consist in the small creature. So do we put our life into every act. The true doctrine of omnipresence is that God reappears with all his parts in every moss and cobweb. The value of the universe con- trives to throw itself into every point.

Every secret is told, every crime is pun- ished, every virtue rewarded, every wrong redressed, in silence and certainty. What we call retribution is the universal necessity by which the whole appears wherever a part appears. If you see smoke, there must be fire. If you see a hand or a lil11b, you know that the trunk to which it belongs is there behind.

The causal retribution is in 1 he COMPENSATION thing and is seen by the soul. The retribution in the CirClllTIstance is seen by the understanding; it is inseparable from the thing, but is often spread over a long time and so does not become distinct until after many years. The specific stripes may follow late after the offence, but they follow because they accompany it. Crime and punishment grow out of one stem. Punishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which con- cealed it. Cause and effect, means and ends, seed and fruit, can- not be severed; for the effect already blooms in the cause, the end preexists in the means, the fruit in the seed. \\Vhilst thus the world will be whole and refuses to be disparted, we seek to act partially, to sunder, to appropriate; for example- to gratify the senses we sever the pleasure of the senses from the needs of the character. The ingenuity of man has always been dedicated to the solution of one problem-how to detach the sensual sweet, the sensual strong, the sensual bright, etc., from the moral sweet, the moral deep, the moral fair; that is, again, to contrive to cut clean off this upper surface so thin as to leave it bottomless; to get a one end, without an other end. The soul says, 'Eat; , the body would feast. The soul says, 'The nlan and woman shall be one flesh and one soul;' the body would join the flesh only.

The soul says, 'Have dominion over all things to the ends of virtue'; the body would have the power over things to its own ends. The soul strives amain to live and work through all things. It would be the only fact. All things shall be added unto it-power, pleasure, knowledge, beauty. The particular man aims to be somebody; to set up for himself; to truck and higgle for a pri- vate good; and, in particulars, to ride that he may ride; to dress that he may be dressed; to eat that he may eat; and to govern, that he may be seen. l\\fen seek to be great; they would have offices, wealth, power and fame. They think that to be great is to possess one side of nature-the sweet, without the other side, the bitter. This dividing and detaching is steadily counteracted. Up to this day it must be owned no projector has nad the smallest suc- cess. The parted water reunites behL.'ld our hand. Pleasure is ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 177 taken out of pleasant things, profit out of profitable things, power out of strong things, as soon as we seek to separate them from the whole. We can no more halve things and get the sensual good, by itself, than we can get an inside that shall have no outside, or a light without a shadow. \"Drive out Nature with a fork, she comes running back.\" Life invests itself with inevitable conditions, which the unwise seek to dodge, which one and another brags that he does not know, that they do not touch him; but the brag is on his lips, the conditions are in his soul.", "out Nature with a fork, she comes running back.\" Life invests itself with inevitable conditions, which the unwise seek to dodge, which one and another brags that he does not know, that they do not touch him; but the brag is on his lips, the conditions are in his soul. If he escapes them in one part they attack him in another more vital part. If he has escaped them in form and in the appearance, it is because he has resisted his life and fled from himself, and the retribution is so much death. So signal is the failure of all attempts to make this separation of the good from the tax, that the experiment would not be tried- since to try it is to be mad-but for the circumstance that when the disease began in the will, of rebellion and separation, the in- tellect is at once infected, so that the man ceases to see God whole in each object, but is able to see the sensual allurement of an object and not see the sensual hurt; he sees the mermaid's head but not the dragon's tail, and thinks he can cut off that which he would have from that which he would not have. \"How secret art thou who dwellest in the highest heavens in silence, 0 thou only great God, sprinkling with an unwearied providence certain penal blindness upon such as have unbridled desires!\" The human soul is true to these facts in the painting of fable) of history, of law, of proverbs, of conversation.

Thus the Greeks called Jupiter, Supreme Mind; but having traditionally ascribed to him many base ac- tions, they involuntarily made amends to reason by tying up the hands of so bad a god. He is made as helpless as a king of England. Prometheus knows one secret which Jove must bargain for; Minerva, another. He cannot get his own thunders; Minerva keeps the key of them:- \"Of all the gods, I only know the keys That ope the solid doors within whose vaults His thunders sleep.\" COMPENSATION A plain confession of the in-working of the All and of its moral aim. The Indian mythology ends in the same ethics; and it would r;eem impossible for any fable to be invented and get any cur- rency which was not moral. Aurora forgot to ask youth for her lover, and though Tithonus is immortal, he is old. Achilles is not quite invulnerable; the sacred waters did not wash the heel by which Thetis held him. Siegfried, in the Nibelungen, is not quite immortal, for a leaf fell on his back whilst he was bathing in the dragon's blood, and that spot which it covered is mortal. And ')0 it must be. There is a crack in every thing God has made. It would seem there is always this vindictive circumstance stealing in at unawares even into the wild poesy in which the human fane), attempted to make bold holiday and to shake itself free of the old laws-this back-stroke, this kick of the gun, certifying that the law is fatal; that in nature _ .. othing can be given, all things are sold.

This is that ancient doctrine of Nemesis, who keeps watch in the universe and lets no offence go unchastised. The Furies, they said, are attendants on justice, and if the sun in heaven should transgress his path they would punish him. The poets re- lated that stone walls and iron swords and leathern thongs had an occult sympathy with the wrongs of their owners; that the belt which Aja.:t gave Hector dragged the Trojan hero ov~r the field at the wheels of the car of Achilles. and the sword which Hector gave Aja..\"{ was that on whose point Ajax felL They re- corded that when the Thasians erected a statue to Theagenes, a victor in the games, one of his rivals went to it by night and en- deavored to throw it down by repeated blows, until at last he moved it from its pedestal and was crushed to death beneath its fall. This voice of fable has in it somewhat divine. It came from thought above the will of the writer. That is the best part of each writer which has nothing private in it; that which he does not know; that which flowed out of his constitution and not from his too active invention; that which in the study of a single ~rtist you might not easily find, but in the study of many you would abstract as the spirit of them all. Phidias it is not, but the work ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 179 of man in that early Hellenic world that I would know.

Phidias it is not, but the work ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 179 of man in that early Hellenic world that I would know. The name and circumstance of Phidias, however convenient for his- tory, embarrass when vve come to the highest criticism. We are to see that which man was tending to do in a given period, and was hindered, or, if you will, modified in doing, by the interfer- ing volitions of Phidias, of Dante, of Shakspeare, the organ whereby man at the moment wrought. Still more striking is the expression of this fact in the proverbs of all nations, which are always the literature of reason, or the statements of an absolute truth without qualification. Proverbs, like the sacred books of each nation, are the sanctuary of the intuitions. That which the droning world, chained to appear .. ances, will not allow the realist to say in bis own words, it will suffer him to say in proverbs without contradiction. And this law of laws, which the pulpit, the senate and the college deny, is hourly preached in all markets and workshops by flights of proverbs, whose teaching is as true and as omnipresent as that of birds and flies. All things are double, one against another.-Tit for tat; an eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; blood for blood; nleasure for measure; love for love.-Give, and it shall be given you.- He that watereth shall be watered himself.-\\Vhat will you have? quoth God; pay for it and take it.-:t'fothing venture, nothing have.-Thou shalt be paid exactly for what thou hast done, no more, no less.-Who doth not work shall not eat.-Harm watch, harm catch.-Curses", "love.-Give, and it shall be given you.- He that watereth shall be watered himself.-\\Vhat will you have? quoth God; pay for it and take it.-:t'fothing venture, nothing have.-Thou shalt be paid exactly for what thou hast done, no more, no less.-Who doth not work shall not eat.-Harm watch, harm catch.-Curses always recoil on the head of him who impre- cates them.-If you [,ut a chain around the neck of a slave, the other end fastens itself around your own.-Bad counsel con- !ounds the adviser.-The Devil is an ass. It is thus written, because it is thus in life. Our action is over- n;.astered and characterized above our will by the law of nature. \"!vVe aim at a petty end quite aside from the public good, but our S.ct arranges itself by irresistible magnetism in a line with the poles of the world. A man cannot speak but he judges himself. With his will or against his will he draws his portrait to the eye of his companjon~ by every word. Every opinion reacts on him who utters it.

Or rather it is a harpoon hurled at the whale, lmwinding, as it flies, a coil of cord in the boat, and, if the har ... poon is not good, or not well thrown, it will go nigh to cut the steersman in twain or to sink. the boat.

The exclusive in fashionable life does not see that he excludes himself from enjoyment, in the attempt to appropriate it. The exclusionist in religion does not see that he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in striving to shut out others. Treat men as pawns and ninepins and you shall suffer as well as they. If you leave out their heart, you shall lose your own. The senses would make things of all persons; of women, of children, of the poor. The vulgar proverb, \"1 will get it from his purse or get it from his skin,\" is sound philosophy. All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are speedily punished. They are punished by fear. Whilst I stand in simple relations to my fellow-man, I have no displeasure in meet .. ing him. 'Ve meet as water meets water, or as two currents of air mix, with perfect diffusion and interpenetration of nature. But as soon as there is any departure from simplicity and attempt at halfness, or good for me that is not good for him, my neighbor feels the wrong; he shrinks from me as far as I have shrunk from him; his eyes no longer seek 'mine; there is war between us; there is hate in him and fear in me.

The terroi of cloudless noon, the emerald of Polycrates, the awe of pros- perity, the instinct which leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks of a noble asceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of the balance of justice through the heart and mind of man.

He may soon come to see that he had better have broken his own bones than to have ridden in his neighbor's coach, and that \"the highest price he can pay for a thing is to ask for it.\" A wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life, and know that it is the part of prudence to face every claimant and pay every just demand on your time, your talents, or your heart. Always pay; for first or last you must pay your entire debt. Per .. sons and events may stand for a time between you and justice, but it is only a postponement. You must pay at last your own debt. If you are wise you will dread a prosperity which only loads you with more. Benefit is the end of nature. But for every benefit which you receive, a tax is levied. He is great who confers the most benefits. He is base-and that is the one base thing in the universe-to receive favors and render none. In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive must be ren- dered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to some .. body. Beware of too much good staying in your band. It will fast corrupt and worln worms.

It is best to pay in your land a skilful gardener, or to buy good sense applied to gardening; in your sailor, good sense ap- plied to navigation; in the house, good sense applied to cooking, sewing, serving; in your agent, good sense applied to accounts and affairs. So do you multiply your presence, or spread yourself throughout your estate. But because of the dual constitution of things, in labor as in life there can be no cheating. The thief steals fronl himself\" The swindler swindles himself. For the real price of labor is knowledge and virtue, whereof wealth and credit are signs. These signs, like paper money, may be counterfeited or stolen, but that which they represent, namely, knowledge and virtue, cannot be counterfeited or stolen. These ends of labor cannot be answered but by real exertions of the mind, and in obedience to pure motives. The cheat, the defaulter, the gambler, cannot extort the knowledge of nlaterial and moral nature which his honest care and pains yield to the operative. The law of na- ture is, Do the thing, and you shall have the power; but they who do not the thing have not the power.

The ab- solute balance of Give and Take, the doctrine that every thing has its price-and if that price is not paid, not that thing but something else is obtained, and that it is impossible to get any- thing without its price-is not less sublime in the columns of a leger than in the budgets of states, in the laws of light and dark- ness, in all the action and reaction of nature. I cannot doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those processes with which he is conversant, the stern ethics which sparkle on his chisel-edge, which are measured out by his plumb and foot- rule, which stand as manifest in the footing of the shop-hill as in the history of a state--do recommend to him his trade, anc1 though seldom named, exalt his business to his imagination.

The nature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.

The history of persecution is a history of endeavors to cheat nature, to make water run up hill, to twist a rope of sand. It ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 185 Dlakes no difference whether the actors be many or one, a tyran1 or a mob. A mob is a society of bodies voluntarily bereaving themselves of reason and traversing its work. The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast. Its fit hour of activity is night. Its actions are insane, like its whole constitution. It persecutes a principle; it would whip a right; it would tar and feather justice, by inflicting fire and outrage upon the houses and persons of those who have these. It resembles the prank of boys, who run with fire-engines to put out the ruddy aurora streaming to the stars. The inviolate spirit turns their spite against the wrongdoers. The martyr cannot be dishonored. Every lash in- flicted is a tongue of fame; every prison a more illustrious abode; every burned book or house enlightens the world; every sup ... pressed or expunged word reverberates through the earth from side to side. Hours of sanity and consideration are always arriv .. ing to communities, as to individuals, when the truth is seen and the martyrs are justified. Thus do all things preach the indifferency of circumstances. The man is all. Every thing has two sides, a good and an evil. Every advantage has its ta...\"'{. I learn to be content. But the doc- trine of compensation is not the doctrine of indifferency.

The thoughtless say, on hearing these representations-What boots it to do well? there is one event to good and evil; if I gain any good I must pay for it; if I lose any good I gain some other; all actions are indifferent. There is a deeper fact in the soul than coolpensation, to wit, its own nature. The soul is not a compensation, but a life. The soul is. Under all this running sea of circumstance, whose waters ebb and flow with perfect balance, lies the aboriginal abyss of real Being. Essence, or God, is not a relation or a part\" but the whole. Being is the vast affirmative, excluding negation, self- balanced, and swallowing up all relations, parts and times within itself. Nature, truth, virtue, are the infiu..x from thence. Vice is the absence or departure of the same. Nothing, Falsehood, may indeed stand as the great Night or shade on which as a back- ground the living universe paints itself forth, gut no fact is be .. gotten by it; it cannot work, for it is not. It cannot work any r86 COMPENSATION good; it cannot work any barm.

There is no stunning confutation of his nonsense before men and angels .. Has he therefore outwitted the law? Inasmuch as he carries the n1alignity and the lie with him he so far deceases from nature. In some manner there will be a demonstration of the wrong to the understanding also; but, should we not see it, this deadly de- duction makes square the eternal account. N either can it be said, on the other hand, that the gain of recti- tude must be bought by any loss. There is no penalty to virtue; no penalty to wisdom; they are proper additions of being. In a virtuous action I properly am; in a virtuous act I add to the world; I plant into deserts conquered from Chaos and Nothing and see the darkness receding on the limits of the horizon. There can be no excess to love, none to knowledge, none to beauty, when these attributes are considered in the purest sense. The soul re- fuses limits, and always affirms an Optimism, never a Pessimism .. Man's life is a progress, and not a station. His instinct is trust. Our instinct uses \"more\" and \"less\" in application to man, of the presence oj the soul, and not of its absence; the brave man is greater than the coward; the true, the benevolent, the wise, is more a man and not less, than the fool and knave. There is no tax on the good of virtue, for that is the incoming of God himself, ~r absolute existence, without any comparative. Material good has its tax, and if it came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the next wind will blow it away.

Material good has its tax, and if it came without desert or sweat, has no root in me, and the next wind will blow it away. But all the good of na- ture is the soul's, and may be had if paid for in nature's lawful coin, that is, by labor which the heart and the head allow. I no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example to find a pot of buried gold, knowing that it brings with it new burdens. I do not wish more external goods-neither possessions, nor honors, nor powers, nor persons. The gain is apparent; the tax is certain. But there is TlC) tax on the knowledge that the COIn- ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 18~ pensation exists and that it is not desirable to dig up treasure. Herein I rejoice with a serene eternal peace. I contract the bound- aries of possible mischief. I learn the wisdom of St. Bernard- \"N othing can work me damage except myself; the harm that I sustain I carry about with me, and never am a real sufferer but by my own fault.\" In the nature of the soul is the compensation for the inequali- ties of condition. The radical tragedy of nature seems to be the distinction of lViore and Less. How can Less not feel the pain; how not feel indignation or malevolence towards J\\lore?

He almost shuns their eye; he fears they will upbraid God .. What should they do? It seems a great injustice. But see the facts nearly and these mountainous in- equalities vanish. Love reduces them as the sun melts the iceberg in the sea. The heart and soul of all men being one, this bitterness of His and Mine ceases. His is mine. I am my brother and my brother is me. If I feel over-shadowed and outdone by great neighbors, I can yet love; I can still receive; and he that loveth maketh his own the grandeur he loves. Thereby I make the dis .. covery that my brother is my guardian, acting for me with th& friendliest designs, and the estate I so admired and envied is my own. It is the nature of the soul to appropriate all things. Jesus and Shakspeare are fragments of the soul, and by love I conquer and incorporate them in my own conscious domain. His virtue- is not that mine? His wit-if it cannot be made mine, it is not wit. Such also is the natural history of ~alamity. The changes which break up at short intervals the prosperity of men are advertise- ments of a nature whose law is growth. Every soul is by this in .. trinsic necessity quitting its whole system of things, its friends and home and laws and faith, as the shell-fish crawls out of its beautiful but stony case, because it no longer admits of its growth, and slowly forms a new bouse.

In proportion to the vigor of the individual these revolutions are frequent, until in some happier mind they are incessant and all worldly relations hang very loosely about him, becoming as it were a transparent fluid 188 COMPENSATION membrane through which the living form is seen, and not, as in most men, an indurated heterogeneous fabric of lnany dates and of no settled character, in which the man is imprisoned. Then there can be enlargement, and the man of to-day scarcely recog- nizes the man of yesterday. And such should be the outward biography of man in time, a putting off of dead circumstances day by day, as he renews his raiment -day by day. But to us, in our lapsed estate, resting, not advancing, resisting, not cooperat .. ing with the divine expansion, this growth comes by shocks. We cannot part with our friends. We cannot let our angels go. We do not see that they only go out that archangels may come in. We are idolaters of the old. We do not believe in the riches of the soul, in its proper eternity and omnipresence. We do not believe there is any force in to-day to rival or recreate that beau ... tiful yesterday. We linger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had bread and shelter and organs, nor believe that the spirit can feed, cover, and nerve us again. We cannot again find aught so dear, so sweet, so graceful. But we sit and weep in vain. The voice of the Almighty saith, 'Up and onward for evermore!'

But we sit and weep in vain. The voice of the Almighty saith, 'Up and onward for evermore!' We cannot stay amid the ruins. Neither will we rely on the new; and so we walk ever with reverted eyes, like those monsters who look backwards. And yet the compensations of calamity are made apparent to the understanding also, after long intervals of time. A fever, a mutilation, a cruel disappointment, a loss of wealth, a loss of friends, seems at the moment unpaid loss, and unpayable. But the sure years reveal the deep remedial force tha t under lies all facts. The death of a dear friend, wife, brother, lover, which seemed nothing but privation, somewhat later assumes the aspect of a guide or genius; for it commonly operates revolutions in our way of life, terminates an epoch of infancy or of youth which was waiting to be closed, breaks up a wonted occupation, or a household, or style of living, and allows the formation of new ones more friendly to the growth of character. It permits or con- strains the formation of new acquaintances and the reception of new influences that prove of the first importance to the next years; and the man or woman who would have remained a sUIlny ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES I89 garden-flower, with no room for its roots and too much sunshine for its head, by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener is made the banian of the for($t, yielding shade and fruit to wide neighborhoods of men.

'WHEN the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look at ourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is .anbosomed in beauty. Behind us, as we go, all things assume pleasing forms, as clouds do far off. Not only things familiar and stale, but even the tragic and terrible are comely as they take their place in the pictures of memory. The river-bank, the weed at the water-side, the old house, the foolish person, however neglected in the passing, have a grace in the past. Even the corpse that has lain in the chambers has added a solemn ornament to the house. The soul will not know either deformity or pain. If in the hours of clear reason we should speak the severest truth, we should say that we had never made a sacrifice. In these hours the mind seems so great that nothing can be taken from us that seems much. All loss, aU pain, is particular; the universe remains to the heart unhurt.

No man need be perplexed in his speculations. Let him do and say what strictly belongs to him, and though very ignorant of books, his nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and doubts. Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin, origin of evil, predestination and the like. These never presented a prac ... tical difficulty to any man-never darkened across any man's road who did not go out of his way to seek them .. These are th~ soul's mUlnps and measles and whooping-coughs, and those who have not caught them cannot describe their health or prescribe ~he cure. A simple mind will not know these enemies. It is quite another thing that he should be able to give account of his faith and expound to another the theory of his self-union and freedom. This requires rare gifts.

My will nev~r gave the imag~s in my mind the rank they now take. The regular course of studies, the years of academical and professional education have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under the bench at the Latin School. \\\\That we do not call education is more precious than that which we call so. We form no guess, at the time of receiving a thought, of its com- parative value. And education often wastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural magnetism, which is sure to select what belongs to it. In like manner our moral nature is vitiated by any interference ~\\ of our will. People represent virtue as a struggle, and take to themselves great airs upon their attainments, and the question is everywhere vexed when a noble nature is commended, whether the man is not better who strives with temptation. But there is no merit in the matter. Either God is there or he is not there. We love characters in proportion as they are impulsive and spontane ... ous. The less a man thinks or knows about his virtues the bettel we like him. Timoleon's victories are the best victories, which ran and flowed like Homer's verses, Plutarch said. When we see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful and pleasant as roses, we; SPIRITUAL LAWS must thank God that such things can be and are, and not turn sourly on the angel and say 'Crump is a better man with his grunting resistance to all", "Plutarch said. When we see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful and pleasant as roses, we; SPIRITUAL LAWS must thank God that such things can be and are, and not turn sourly on the angel and say 'Crump is a better man with his grunting resistance to all his native devils.' Not less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over will in all practical life. There is less intention in history than we ascrit e to it. We impute deep-laid far-sighted plans to Cresar and Napoleon; but the best of their power was in nature, not in them. Men of an extraordinary success, in their honest moments, have always sung 'Not unto us, not unto us.' According to the faith of their times they have built altars to Fortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian. Their success lay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which found in them an unobstructed channel; and the wonders of which they were the visible conductors seemed to the eye their deed. Did the wires generate the galvanism? It is even true that there was less in them on which they could reflect than in another; as the virtue of a pipe is to be smooth and hollow. That which externally seemed will and immovableness was will- ingness and self-annihilation. Could Shakspeare give a theory of Shakspeare? Could ever a man of prodigious mathematical genius convey to others any insight into his methods? If he could com- municate that secret it would instantly lose its exaggerated value, blending with the daylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go. The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a happier", "it would instantly lose its exaggerated value, blending with the daylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go. The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a happier place than it is; that there is no need of struggles, convulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing of the teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere with the optimism of nature; for whenever we get this vantage-ground of the past, or of a wiser mind in the .present, we are able to discern that we are begirt with laws which ..execute themselves. The face of external nature teaches the same lesson. Nature will not have us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our learning much better than she likes our frauds and wars. When we come out of the caucus, or the bank, or the Abolition- convention, or the Temperance-meeting, or the Transcendental ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 193 club into the fields and woods, she says to us, 'So hot? my little Sir.' We are full of mechanical actions. \\Ve must needs intermeddle and have things in our own way, until the sacrifices and virtues of society are odious. Love should make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our Sunday-schools and churches and pauper-soci- \u2022 eties are yokes to the neck.. We pain ourselves to please nobody. 1 There are natural ways of arriving at the san1e ends at which II these aim, but do not arrive. Why should all virtue work in one { and the same way?

And why drag this dead weight of a Sunday-school over the whole Christendom? It is natural and beautiful that childhood should inquire and maturity should teach; but it is time enough to answer questions when they are asked. Do not shut up the young people against their will in a pew and force the children to ask them questions for an hour against their will. If we look wider, things are all alike; laws and letters and \\' creeds and modes of living seem a travesty of truth. Our society is encumbered by ponderous machinery, which resembles the endless aqueducts which the Romans built over hill and dale and which are superseded by the discovery of the law that water rises to the level of its source. It is a Chinese wall which any .. nimble Tartar can leap over. It is a standing anny, not so good as a peace. It is a graduated, titled, richly appointed empire, quite superfluous when towl1-lneetings are found to answer just as well. Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways.

Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways. When the fruit is ripe, it falls. When the fruit is despatched, the leaf falls. The circuit of the waters is mere falling. The walk- . ing of man and all animals is a falling forward. All our manual labor and works of strength, as prying, splitting, digging, rowing and so forth, are done by dint of continual falling, and the globe, earth, moon, comet, sun, star, fall for ever and ever. The simplicity of the universe is very different from the sirn\u00b7 194 SPIRITUAL LAWS J plicity of a machine. He who sees moral nature out and out and \\ thoroughly knows how knowledge is acquired and character \\ formed, is a pedant. The simplicity of nature is not that which ; may easily be read, but is inexhaustible. The last analysis can no wise be made. We judge of a man's wisdom by his hope, knowing that the perception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is an im- mortal youth. The wild fertility of nature is felt in comparing out rigid names and reputations with our fluid consciousness. We pass in the world for sects and schools, for erudition and piety, and we are all the time jejune babes. One sees very well how Pyrrhonism grew up. Every man sees that he is that middle point whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied with equal reason. He is old, he is young, he is very wise, he is altogether ignorant .. He hears and feels what you say of the seraphim, and uf the tin-peddler. There is no permanent wise man except in the figment of the Stoics.

There is no permanent wise man except in the figment of the Stoics. We side with the hero, as we read or paint, against the coward and the robber; but we have been our- selves that coward and robber, and shall be again-not in the low circumstance, but in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul. A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine. Belief and love-a believing love will relieve us of a vast load of care. 0 my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of nature and over the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the universe .. It has so infused its strong enchantment into nature that we prosper when we accept its advice, and when we struggle to wound its creatures our hands are glued to our sides,. or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. \"Te need only qbey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word.

I say, do not choose; but that is a figure of speech by which I ,,\"ould distinguish what is commonly called choice among men, and which is a partial act, the choice of the hands, of the eyes, of the appetites, and not a whole act of the man.

We must hold a man amenable to reason for the choice of his daily craft or profession. It is not an excuse any longer for his deeds that they are the custom of his trade. What business has he with an evil trade? Has he not a calling in his character? Each man has his own vocation. The talent is the call. There is one direction in which all space is open to him. He has faculties silently inviting him thither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river; he runs against obstructions on every side but one, on that side all obstruction is taken away and he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea. This talent and this call depend on his organization, or the mode in which thf~ general soul incarnates itself in him. He inclines to do somethin(l which is easy to him and good when it is done, but which no other man can do. He has no rival. For the more truly he consults hin own powers, the more difference will his work exhibit from tht! work of any other. His ambition is exactly proportioned to his powers.

By doing his ~ork he makes the need felt which he can supp1y, l and creates the taste by which he is enjoyed. ~y doing his own work he unfolds himself. It is the vice of our public speaking that it has not abandonment. Somewhere, not only every orator but every man should let out all the length of all the reins; should find or make a frank and hearty expression of what force and meaning is in him. The common experience is that the man fits himself as well as he can to the customary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as a dog turns a spit. Then is he a part of the machine he moves; the man is lost. Until he can manage to communicate himself to others in his full stature and proportion, he does not yet find his vocation. He must find in that an outlet for his character, so that he may justify his work to their eyes. If the labor is mean, let him by his thinking and character make it liberal. Whatever he knows and thinks, what~ ever in his apprehension is worth doing, that let him communi~ cate, or men will never know and honor him aright.

A man's genius. the quality that differ- ences him from every other, the susceptibility to one class of influences, the selection of what is fit for him, the rejection of what is unfit, determines for him the character of the universe. A man is a method, a progressive arrangement; a selecting prin- ciple, gathering his like to him wherever he goes. He takes only his own out of the multiplicity that sweeps and circles round him. He is like one of those booms which are set out from the shore on rivers to catch drift-wood, or like the loadstone amongst splinters of steel. Those facts, words, persons, which dwell in his memory without his being able to say why, remain because they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet unap- prehended.

To the thoughts of that state of mind he has a right. All the secrets of that state of mind he can compel. This is a law which statesmen use in practice. All the terrors of the French Republic, which held Austria in awe, were unable to command her diplomacy.

If a teacher have any opinion which be wishes to conceal, his pupils will become as fully indoctrinated into that as into any which he publishes. If you pour water into a vessel twisted into coils and angles, it is vain to say, I will pour it only into this or that; it will find its level in all. Men feel and act the conse- quences of your doctrine without being able to show how they follow. Show us an arc of the curve, and a good mathematician will find out the whole figure. We are always reasoning from the seen to the unseen. Hence the perfect intelligence that subsists between wise men of remote ages. A man cannot bury his mean- ings so deep in his book but time and like-minded men will find them. Plato had a secret doctrine, had he?

Not in nature but in man is all the beauty and worth he sees. The world is very empty, and is indebted to this gilding, exalting soul for all its pride. \"Earth fills her lap with splendors\" not her own. The vale of Tempe, Tivoli and Rome are earth and ,vater, rock'S and sky. There are as good earth and water in a thousand places, yet how unaffecting! People are not the better for the sun and moon, the horizon and the trees; as it is not observed that the keepers of Roman galleries or the valets of painters have any elevation of thought, or that librarians are wiser men than others.

The good, com pared to the evil which he sees, is as his own good to his own evil. Every quality of his Inind is magnified in some one acquaintance, and every emotion of his heart in some one.

Nothing is more deeply punished than the neglect of the affinities by which alone society should be formed~ and the insane levity of choosing associates by others' eyes. He may set his own rate. It is a maxim worthy of all accepta ... tion that a man may have that allowance he takes. Take the place and attitude which belong to you, and all men acquiesce. The world must be just. It leaves every man, with profound unconcern, to set his own rate. Hero or driveller, it meddles not in the matter. It will certainly accept your own measure of your doing and being, whether you sneak about and deny your own name, or whether you see your work produced to the concave sphere of the heavens, one with the revolution of the stars. The c;arne reality pervades all teaching. The man may teach by doing) and not otherwise. If he can communicate himself he can teach, but not by words. He teaches who gives, and he learns who receives.

If we had reason to expect such a confidence we should go through all inconvenience and opposi ... tion. The sick would be carried in litters. But a public oration is an escapade, a non-committal, an apology, a gag, and not a com- munication, not a speech, not a man. A like Nemesis presides over all intellectual works. ,\\\\Te have yet to learn that the thing uttered in words is not therefore af- firmed. It must affirm itself, or no forms of logic or of oath can give it evidence. The sentence must also contain its own apology for being spoken. The effect of any writing on the public mind is mathematically measurable by its depth of thought. How much water does it draw? If it awaken you to think, if it lift you from your feet with the great voice of eloquence, then the effect is to be wide, slow, pernlanent, over the minds of men; if the pages instruct you not, they will die like flies in the hour.

The argument which has not power to reach my own practice, I may well doubt will fail to reach yours. But take Sidney's maxim:-\"Look in thy heart, and write.\" He that writes to him- self writes to an eternal public. That statement only is fit to be made public which you have come at in attempting to satisfy your own curiosity. ~The writer who takes his subject from his ear and not from his heart, should know that he has lost as much as he seems to have gained, and when the empty book has gath- ered all its praise, and half the people say, (What poetry 1 what genius!' it still needs fuel to make fire. That only profits which is profitable. Life alone can impart life; and though we should burst we can only be valued as we make ourselves valuable. There is no luck in literary reputation. They who make up the final verdict upon every book are not the partial and noisy read- ers of the hour when it appears, but a court as of angels, a public not to be bribed, not to be entreated and not to be over- awed, rlecides upon every man's title to fame.

There are not in the world at anyone time more than a dozen persons who read and understand Plato -never enough to pay for an edition of his works; yet to every generation these come duly down, for the sake of those few per- sons, as if God brought them in his hand. \"No book,\" said Bent- ley, \"was ever written down by any but itself.\" 1'be permanence of all books is fixed by no effort, friendly or hostile, but by their own specific gravity, or the intrinsic importance t their contents to the constant mind of man. \"Do not trouble yourself too much about the light on your statue,\" said 11ichael Angelo to the young sculptor; \"the light of the public square will test its value.\" In like manner the effect of every action is measured by the depth of the sentiment from which it proceeds. The 'Sreat man knew not that he was great. It took a century or two for that fact to appear. What he did, he did because he must; it was the most natural thing in the world, and grew out of the circum- stances of the moment.

These are the demonstrations in a few particulars of the genius of nature; they show the direction of the stream. But the stream is blood; every drop is alive. Truth has not single victories; all things are its organs-not only dust and stones, but errors and lie~. The laws of disease, physicians say, are as beautiful as the laws of health. Our philosophy is affirmative and readily accept~, the testimony of negative facts, as every shadow points to the sun. By a divine necessity every fact in nature is constrained to offer its testimony. Human character evermore publishes itself. The most fugitivf deed and word, the mere air of doing a thing, the intimated pur- pose, expresses character .. If you act you show character; if you sit still, if you sleep, you show it.

When a man speaks the truth in the spirit of truth, his eye is as clear as the heavens. When he has base ends and speaks falsely, the eye is muddy and sometimes asquint. I have heard an experienced counsellor say that he never feared the effect upon a jury of a lawyer who does not believe in his heart that his client ought to have a verdict. If he does not believe it his unbelief will appear to the jury, despite all his protesta- tions, and will become their unbelief. This is that law whereby a work of art, of whatever kind, sets us in the same state of mind wherein the artist was when he made it. That which we do not believe we cannot adequately say, though we may repeat the words never so often. It was this conviction which Swedenborg expressed when he described a group of persons in the spiritual world endeavoring in vain to articulate a proposition which they did not believe; but they could not, though they twisted and folded their lips even to indignation. A man passes for what he is worth. Very idle is all curiosity concerning other people's estimate of us, and all fear of remain- ing unknown is not less so. If a man know that he can do any thing-that he can do it better than anyone else-he has a pledge of the acknowledgment of that fact by all persons.

A fop may sit in any chair of the world nor be distinguished for his hour from Homer and Washington; but there need never be any doubt concerning the respective ability of human beings. Pretension may sit still, but cannot act. Pretension never feigned an act of real greatness. Pretension never wrote an Iliad, nor drove back Xerxes, nor christianized the world, nor abolished slavery. As much virtue as there is, so much appears; as much goorl- ness as there is, so much reverence it commands. All the devils respect virtue.

Never a magnanimity fell to the ground, but there is some heart to greet and accept it unexpectedly. A man passes for that he is worth. What he is engraves itself on his face, on his form, on his fortunes, in letters of light. Con- cealment avails him nothing, boasting nothing. There is con- fession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations, and the grasp of hands. His sin bedaubs him, mars all his good impression. Men know not why they do not trust him, but they do not trust him. His vice glasses his eye, cuts lines of mean ex- pression in his cheek, pinches the nose, sets the mark of the beast on the back of the head, and writes 0 fool! fool! on thta forehead of a king. If you would not be known to do any thing, never do it. A man may play the fool in the drifts of a desert, but every grain of sand shall seem to see. He may be a solitary eater, but he cannot keep his foolish counsel. A broken complexion, a swinish look, ungenerous acts and the want of due knowledge-all blab. Can a cook, a Chiffinch, an Iachimo be mistaken for Zeno or Paul? Confucius exclaimed-\"How can a man be concealed?

Vir- tue is the adherence in action to the nature of things and the nature of things makes it prevalent. It consists in a perpetual substitution of being for seeming, and with sublime propriety God is described as saying, I AM. The lesson which these observations convey is, Be, and not seen1. Let us acquiesce. Let us take our bloated nothingness out of the path of the divine circuits. Let us unlearn our wisdom of the world. Let us lie low in the Lord's power and learn that truth alone makes rich and great. If you visit your friend, why need you apologize for not having visited him, and waste his time and deface your own act? Visit him now.

Or why need you torment yourself and friend by secret self-reproaches that you have not assisted him or complimented him with gifts and salutations heretofore? Be a gift and a benediction. Shine with real light and not with the borrowed reflection of gifts. Common men are apologies for rilen; they bow the head, excuse themselves with prolix reasons, and accumulate appearances because the substance is not.

The epochs of our life are not in the visible facts of qur choice of a calling, our marriage, our acquisition of an office, and the like, but in a silent thought by the wayside as we walk; in a thought which revises our entire manner of life and says-'Thus hast thou done, but it were better thus.' And all our after years, like menials, serve and wait on this, and ac- cording to their ability execute its will. This revisal or correc- tion is a constant force, which, as a tendency, reaches through our lifetime.

Nor can you, if 1 am true, excite me to the least uneasiness by saying, 'He acted and thou sittest still.' I see action to be good, when the need is, and sitting still to be also good. Epaminondas, if he was the man I take him for, would have sat still with joy and peace, if his lot had been mine. Heaven is large, and affords space for all modes of love and fortitude. Why should we be busy-bodies and superserviceable? Action and inaction are alike to the true. One piece of the tree is cut for a weathercock and one for the sleep(t' of a bridge; the virtue of the wood is apparent in both. I desire not to disgrace the soul.

'T is a trick of the senses-no more. We know that the ancestor of every action is a thought. The poor mind does not seem to itself to be any thing unless it have an outside badge-some Gentoo diet, or Quaker coat, or Calvinistic prayer-meeting, or philan- thropic society, or a great donation, or a high office, or, any how, some wild contrasting action to testify that it i~ <:omewhat. The 208 SPIRITUAL LAWS rich mind lies in the sun and sleeps, and is Nature. To think is to act. Let us, if we must have great actions, make our own so.

I can think of nothing to fill my time with, and I find the Life of Brant. It is a very extravagant compliment to pay to Brant, or to General Schuyler, or to General Wash- ington.

Rather let me do my work so well that other idlers if they choose may com- pare my texture with the texture of these and find it identical with the best. This over-estimate of the possibilities of Paul and Pericles, this under-estimate of our own, comes from a neglect of the fact of an identical nature. Bonaparte knew but one merit, and rewarded in one and the same way the good soldier, the good astronomer, the good poet, the good player. The poet uses the names of Cresar, of Tamerlane, of Bonduca, of Belisarius; the painter uses the conventional story of the Virgin Mary, of Paul, of Peter. He does not therefore defer to the nature of these accidental men, of these stock. heroes.

The introduction to this felicity is in a private and tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment of human life; which, like a certain divine rage and enthusiasm, seizes on man at one period and works a revolution in his mind and body; unites him to his race, pledges him to the domestic and civic relations, carries him with new sympathy into nature, enhances the power of the senses, opens the imagination, adds to his character heroic and sacred attributes, establishes marriage and gives permanence to human society_ The natural association of the sentiment of love with the hey- day of the blood seems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints, which every youth and maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience, one must not be too old. The delicious fancies of youth reject the least favor of a mature philosophy, as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom.

ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 211 caught from a wandering spark out of another private heart, glows and enlarges until it warms and bean1s upon multitudes of men and women, upon the universal heart of all, and so lights up the whole world and all nature with its generous flames. It matters not therefore whether we attempt to describe the passion at twenty, thirty, or at eighty years. He who paints it at the first period will lose some of its later, he who paints it at the last, SOlne of its earlier traits. Only it is to be hoped that by patience and the l\\luses' aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall describe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that it shall commend itself to the eye at whatever angle beholden. And the first condition is that we must leave a too close and lingering adherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it ap- \u00b7 peared in hope, and not in history. For each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured, as the life of man is not to his imagina- tion. Each man sees over his own e;,:perience a certain stain of error, whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal.

Each man sees over his own e;,:perience a certain stain of error, whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal. Let any man go back to those delicious relations which make the beauty of his life, which have given him sincerest instruction and nourish- ment, he will shrink and moan. Alas! I know not why, but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of bud- ding joy, and cover every beloved name. Every thing is beautiful seen from the point of the intellect, or as truth. But all is sour if seen as experience. Details are melancholy; the plan is seemly and noble. In the actual world-the painful kingdom of time and place-dwell care and canker and fear. \\Vith thought, with the .,; ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of joy. Round it all the, Muses sing. But grief cleaves to names ann persons and the j partial interests of to-day and yesterday. The strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of personal relations usurps in the conversation of society. What do we wish to know of any worthy person so much as ~.,w he has sped in the history of this sentiment? What books in the circulating library circ..ulate? How we glow over these novels of passion, when the story is told with any spark of truth and na- ture! And what fastens attention, in the intercourse of life, like 2I2 LOVE any passage betraying affection between two parties? Perhaps we never saw them before and never shall meet them again.

But we see them exchange a glance or betray a deep emotion, and ,ve are no longer strangers. We understand them and take the warm .. est interest in the development of the romance All mankind love a lover. The earliest demonstrations of complacency and kind .. ness are nature's most winning pictures. It is the dawn of civility and grace in the coarse and rustic. The rude village boy teases the girls about the school-house door; but to-day he COlnes run .. ning into the entry and rneets one fair child disposing her satcbel; he holds her books to help her, and instantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely, and was a sacred precinct. Among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough, but one alone distances him; and these two little neighbors, that \\overe so close just now, have learned to respect each other's per- sonality. Or who can avert his eyes from the engaging, half- artful, half-artless ways of school-girls who go into the country shops to buy a skein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk half an bour about nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop- boy. In the village they are on a perfect equality, which love tlelights in, and without any coquetry the happy, affectionate nature of woman flows out in this pretty gossip. The girls may have little beauty, yet plainly do they establish between them and the good boy the most agreeable, confiding relations; what with their fun and their earnest, about Edgar and Jonas and Almira, and who was invited to the party, and who danced at the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would begin, and other nothings concerning which", "they establish between them and the good boy the most agreeable, confiding relations; what with their fun and their earnest, about Edgar and Jonas and Almira, and who was invited to the party, and who danced at the dancing-school, and when the singing-school would begin, and other nothings concerning which the parties cooed. By and by that boy wants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he know where to find a sincere and sweet mate, without any risk such as Milton deplores as incident to scholars and great men. I have been told that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for the intellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations. But now I almost shrink at the remenlbrance of such disparaging words. For persons are love's world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the young soul wander'~ here in nature to the power of love, without being ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 213 tempted to unsay, as treasonable to nature, aught derogatory to the social instincts. For though the celestial rapture falling out of heaven seizes only upon those of tender age, and although a beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison and putting us quite beside ourselves we can seldom see after thirty years, yet the remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remem- brances, and is a wreath of flowers on the oldest brows. But here is a strange fact; it may seem to many men, in revising their experience, that they have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection con- trived to give a witchcraft, surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth, to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances. In looking backward they may find that several things which were", "have no fairer page in their life's book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein affection con- trived to give a witchcraft, surpassing the deep attraction of its own truth, to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances. In looking backward they may find that several things which were not the charm have more reality to thi~ groping memory than the charm itself which embalmed them. But be our experi- ence in particulars what it may, no man ever forgot the visita- tions of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things .anew; which was the dawn in him of music, poetry and art; which made the face of nature radiant with purple light, the morning and the night varied enchantments; when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound, and the most trivial circum- stance associated with one form is put in the amber of memory; when he became all eye when one was present, and all memory when one was gone; when the youth becomes a watcher of win- dows and studious of a glove, a veil, a ribbon, or the wheels oi a carriage; when no place is too solitary and none too silent for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in his new thoughts than any old friends, though best and purest, can give him;' for the ngures, the motions, the words of the beloved object are not, like other images, written in water, but, as Plu- tarch said, \"enamelled in fire,\" and make the study of mid- night:- \"Thou art not gone be'lng gone, where'er tnou art, Thou leav'st in hinl thy watchful eyes, in him thy loving hearL\u00b7\u00b7 In the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recol- lection of days", "tarch said, \"enamelled in fire,\" and make the study of mid- night:- \"Thou art not gone be'lng gone, where'er tnou art, Thou leav'st in hinl thy watchful eyes, in him thy loving hearL\u00b7\u00b7 In the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recol- lection of days when happiness was not happy enough, but must 216 LOVE and evanescent. Herein it resembles the most excellent things, which all have this rainbow character, defying all attempts at appropriation and use. What else did Jean Paul Richter signify, when he said to music, \"Away! away! thou speakest to me of things which in all my endless life I have not found and shall not find.\" The same fluency may be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue is then beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out of criticism and can no longer be defined by compass and measuring-wand, but de .. mands an active imagination to go with it and to say what it is in the act of doing. The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented in a transition from that which is representable to the senses, to that which is not. Then first it ceases to be a stone. The same remark holds of painting. And of poetry the success is not attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it astonishes and fires us with new endeavors after the unattainable. Concerning it Landor inquires '~whether it is not to be referred to some purer state of sensation and existence.\" In like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself when it dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an end; when it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions", "it is not to be referred to some purer state of sensation and existence.\" In like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself when it dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an end; when it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions ; when it makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when he cannot feel his right to it, though he were Cresar; he cannot feel more right to it than to the firma- ment and the splendors of a sunset. Hence arose the saying, \"If I love you, what is that to you?\" We say so because we feel that what we love is not in your will~ but above it. It is not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in yourself and can never know. This agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient writers delighted in; for they said that the soul of man, embodied here on earth, went roaming up and down in quest of that other world of its own out of which it came into this, but was soon stupefied by the light of the natural sun, and un~ able to see any other objects than those of this world, which are but shadows of real things. Therefore the Deity sends the glory of youth before the soul, that it may avail itself of beautiful ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 2I7 bodies as aids to its recollection of the celestial good and fair; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to her and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, move ... ment and intelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of that which indeed is within the beauty, and", "good and fair; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex runs to her and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, move ... ment and intelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of that which indeed is within the beauty, and the cause of the beauty. _ -If however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul was gross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped nothing but sorrow; body being unable to fulfil the prom\u00b7 I ise which beauty holds out; but if, accepting the hint of these I visions and suggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the ' soul passes through the body and falls to admire strokes of char- \\ acter, and\\ the lovers contemplate one another in their discourses ~ and their actions, then they pass to the true palace of beauty, q more and more inflame their love of it, and by this love extin- / guishing the base affection, as the sun puts out fire by shining on \\ the hearth, they become pure and hallowed. By conversation ~ with that which is in itself excellent, magnanimous, lowly, and just, the lover comes to a warmer love of these nobilities, and a quicker apprehension of them. Then he passes from loving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the one beautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the society of all true and pure souls. In the particular society of his mate he attains a clearer sight of any spot, any taint which her beauty has can .. tracted from this world, and is able to point it out, and this with mutual joy that they are now able, without offence, to indicate \"l.!", "souls.

And beholding in many souls the traits of the divine beauty, and separating in each soul that which is divine from the taint which it has contracted in the world, the lover ascends to the highest beauty, to love and knowl .. \" edge of Divinity, by steps on this ladder of created souls. Somewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all . ages. The doctrine is not old, nor is it new. If Plato, Plutarch and Apuleius taught it, so have Petrarch, Angelo and Milton. It awaits a truer unfolding in opposition and rebuke to that subter~ ranean prudence which presides at marriages with words tha.t 218 LOVE take hold of the upper world, whilst one eye is prowling in the cellar; so that its gravest discourse has a savor of hams and f>owdering-tubs. Worst, when this sensualisln intrudes into the education of young women, and withers the hope and affection of human nature by teaching that marriage signifies nothing but a housewife's thrift, and that wOlnan's life has no other aira. But this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one scene in our play. In the procession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges its circles ever, like the pebble thrown into the pond, or the light proceeding from an orb.

In the procession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges its circles ever, like the pebble thrown into the pond, or the light proceeding from an orb. The rays of the soul alight first on things 'nearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses and domestics, on the bouse and yard and passengers, on the circle of household acquaintance, on politics and geography and his ... tory. But things are ever grouping thenlselves according to higher or more interior laws. Neighborhood, size, numbers, habits, per- sons, lose by degrees their power over us. Cause and effect, real , affinities, the longing for harmony between the soul and the \" circumstances, the progressive, idealizing instinct, predominate later, and the step backward from the higher to the lower rela- tions is impossible. Thus even love, which is the deification of persons, must become more impersonal every day. Of this at first it gives no hint. Little think the youth and maiden who are glanc- ing at each other across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual intelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to pro- ceed from this new, quite external stimulus. The work of vegeta- tion begins first in the irritability of the bark and leaf-buds. From exchanging glances, they advance to acts of courtesy, of gal- lantry, then to fiery passion, to plighting troth and marriage. Passion beholds its object as a perfect unit. The soul is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly ensouled:- \"Her pure and eloquent blood \" Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought, That one might almost say her body thought.\" Romeo, if dead, should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens fine.

Night, day, studies, talents, king- ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 2I9 dams, religion, are all contained in this form full of soul, in this soul which is all form. The lovers delight in endearments, in avowals of love, in comparisons of their regards. \\V'hen alone, they solace themselves with the ren1embered image of the other. Does that other see the same star, the same melting cloud, read the same book, feel the same emotion, that now delights me? They try and ,veigh their affection, and adding up costly advan\" tages, friends, opportunities, properties, exult in discovering that willingly, joyfully, they would give all as a ransom for the beau ... tiful, the beloved head, not one hair of which shall be harmed. But the lot of humanity is on these children. Danger, sorrow and pain arrive to them as to all. Love prays. It makes covenants with Eternal Power in behalf of this dear mate. The union which is thus effected and which adds a new value to every atom in nature-for it transmutes every thread throughout the whole web of relation into a golden ray, and bathes the soul in a ne,v and sweeter element-is yet a temporary state.

Not always can flow- ers, pearls, poetry, protestations, nor even home in another heart, content the awful soul that dwells in clay. It arouses itself at last from these endearments, as toys, and puts on the harness and aspires to vast and universal aims. The soul which is in the soul of each, craving a perfect beatitude, detects incongruities, defects and disproportion in the behavior of the other. Hence arise sur .. prise, expostulation and pain. Yet that which drew them to each other was signs of loveliness, signs of virtue; and these virtues are there, however eclipsed. They appear and reappear and can .. tinue to attract; but the regard changes, quits the sign and attaches to the substance. This repairs the wounded affection. Meantime, as life wears on, it proves a game of permutation and combiQation of all possible positions of the parties, to employ an the resources of each and acquaint each with the strength and weakness of the other. ~'or it is the nature and end of this rela- tion, that they should represent the human race to each other.- All that is in the world, which is or ought to be known, is cun\" ningly wrought into the texture of man, of woman:- \"The person love does to us fit, ~ike manna, has the taste of all in it.\" 220 LOVE The world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour.

If there be virtue, all the vices are known as such; they confess and flee. Their once flaming regard is sobered by time in either breast, and losing in violence what it gains in extent, it becomes a thorough good understanding. They resign each other without complaint to the good offices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in time, and exchange the pas- sion which once could not lose sight of its object, for a cheerful disengaged furtherance, whether present or absent, of each other's designs. At last they discover that all which at first drew them together-those once sacred features, that magical play of charms-was deciduous, had a prospective end, like the scaf- folding by which the house was built; and the purification of the intellect and the heart from year to year is the real marriage, foreseen and prepared from the first, and wholly above their consciousness. Looking at these aims with which two persons, a man and a woman, so variously and correlatively gifted, are shut up in one house to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty years, I do not wonder at the emphasis with which the heart prophesies this crisis from early infancy, at the profuse beauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower, and nature and intellect and art emulate each other in the gifts and the melody they bring to the epithalamium.

We are by nature observers, and thereby learners. That is our permanent state. But we are often made to feel that our affections are but tents of a night. Though slowly and with pain, the objects of the affections change, as the objects of thought do. There are mo- ments when the affections rule and absorb the man and make his bappiness dependent on a person or persons. But in health the mind is presently seen again-its overarching vault, bright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves and fears, that ~wept over us as clouds, must lose their finite character a:p.d blend ESSAYS: F'tRST SERIES 221 with God, to attain their own perfection.

Maugre all the selfishness that chills like east winds the world, the whole human family is bathed with an element of love like a fine ether.

His arrival almost brings fear to the good hearts that would welcome him. The house is dusted, all things fiy into their places, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get up a dinner if they can. Of a commended stranger, only the good report is told by others, only the good and new is heard by us. He stands to us for humanity. He is what we wish. Having imagined and invested hinl, we ask how we should stand related in con- versation and action with such a man, and are uneasy with fear. The same idea exalts conversation with him. We talk better than we are wont. We have the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, anc our dumb devil has taken leave for the time. For long hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful, rich communications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that they who sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a lively sur- prise at our unusual powers. But as soon as the stranger begins tC' intrude his partialities, his definitions, his defects into the con .. versation, it is all over.

I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the new. Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth himself so to me in his gifts?

Who hears me, who understands me, becomes mine-a pos- session for all time. Nor is Nature so poor but she gives me this joy several times, and thus we weave social threads of our own, a new web of relations; and, as many thoughts in succession sub .... stantiate themselves, we shall by and by stand in a new world of Dur own creation, and no longer strangers and pilgrims in a tradi- tionary globe. My friends have come to me unsought. The great ~God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine affinity of -virtue with itself, I find them, or rather not I, but the Deity in me and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of individual character, relation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes many one. High thanks lowe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world for me to new and nobIs depths, and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts. These are new poetry of the first Bard-poetry without stop-hymn, ode and epic, poetry still flowing, Apollo and the lVluses chanting .still .. Will these too separate themselves from me again, or some of them?

I have often had fine fancies about per .. sons which have given me delicious hours; but the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit. Thought is not born of it; my action is very little modified. I must feel pride in my friend's accomplish- ments as if they were mine, and a property in his virtues. I feel as warmly when he is praised, as the lover when he hears ap- plause of his engaged maiden. We over-estimate the conscience of our friend. His goodness seems better than our goodness, his nature finer, his temptations less. Every thing that is bis-his name, his form, his dress, books and instruments-fancy en- hances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from his mouth. Yet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy in the ebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the immor- tality of the soul, is too good to be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not verily that which he wor~ ships; and in the golden hour of friendship we are surprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief. We doubt that we bestow all our hero the virtues in which he shines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation.

We doubt that we bestow all our hero the virtues in which he shines, and afterwards worship the form to which we have ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not respect men as it respects itself.. In strict science all persons underlie the same condition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by mining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple? Shall I not be as real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what they are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though it needs finer organs for its apprehen- sion. The root of the plant is not unsightly to science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the stem short. And I must hazard the production of the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries) though it should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet. A man who stands united with his thought conceives magnificently of himself. He is conscious of a universal success, even though bought by uniform particular failures. No advantages, no pow .. , ers, no gold or force, can be any match for him. I cannot choose but rely on my own poverty more than on your wealth. I cannot ~ make your consciousness tantamount to mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moonlike ray.

I cannot deny it, 0 friend, that the vast shadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted immensity-thee also, compared '\\vith whom all else is shadow. Thou art not Being, as Truth is, as Justice is-thou art not my soul, but a picture _and effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already thou art seizing thy hat and cloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the tree puts forth leaves, and presently, by the germination of new buds, ex ... trudes the old leaf? The law of nature is alternation for evermore Each electrical state superinduces the opposite. The soul en ... virons itself with friends that it may enter into a grander self .. acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a season that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method betrays itself along the whole history of our personal relations. The instinct of affection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of insulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes his life in the search after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment, he might write a letter like this to each new candidate for his love:- DEAR FRIEND, If I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise; my moods are quite attainable, and I respect thy genius; it is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare", "thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise; my moods are quite attainable, and I respect thy genius; it is to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a delicious torment. Thine ever, or never. Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity and aot for life. They are not to be indulged. This is to weave cob- web, and not cloth. Our friendships hurry to short and poor can .. clusions, because we have made them a texture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the human heart. The laws ot friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 22j nature and of morals. But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden sweetness. \\Ve snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which many summers and many winters must ripen. We seek our friend not sacredly, but with an adulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain. We are armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet, begin to play, and translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost all people descend to meet. All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very flower and aroma of the flo~ler of each of the beautiful natures disappears as they approach each other.

Bashfulness and apathy are a tough husk in which a delicate organization is pro., tected from premature ripening. It would be lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to know ana own it.

Let us not have FRIENDSHIP this childish luxury in our regards, but the austerest worth; let ns approach our friend with an audacious trust in the truth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to be overturned, of his foundations. The attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I leave, for the time, all account of subordinate social benefit, to speak of that select and sacred relation which is a kind of abso- lute, and which even leaves the language of love suspicious and common, so much is this purer, and nothing is so nluch divine. I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage. When they are real, they are not glass threads or frost- work, but the solidest thing we know. Far now, after so many ages of experience, what do we know of nature or of ourselves? Not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem of his destiny. In one condemnation of folly stand the whole uni- verse of men. But the sweet sincerity of joy and peace which I draw from this alliance with my brother's soul is the nut itself whereof all nature and all thought is but the husk and shell.

Happier, if he know the solemnity of that relation and honor its law! He who offers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the great games where the first-born of the world are the competitors. He proposes himself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in the lists, and he alone is victor who has trutr. enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of his beauty from the wear and tear of all these. The gifts of for- tune may be present or absent, but all the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic nobleness and the contempt of trifles. There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority in either, no reason why either should be first named. One is truth. A friend is a per- son with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 229 chemical atom meets another ..

Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a sec ... ond person, hypocrisy begins. We parry and fend the approach of our fellow-man by compliments, by gossip, by amusements, by affairs .. We cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds. I knew a man who under a certain religious frenzy cast off this drapery, and omitting all compliment and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he encountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At first he was resisted, and all men agreed he was mad. But persisting-as indeed he could not help doing-for some time in this course, he attained to the advan- tage of bringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him. No man would think of speaking falsely with him, or of putting him off with any chat of markets or reading-rooms. But every man was constrained by so much sincerity to the like plain. dealing, and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of truth he had, he did certainly show him. But to most of us society shows not its face and eye, but its side and its back. To stand in true relations with men in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not? We can seldom go erect. Almost every man we meet re .. quires some civility-requires to be humored; he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy in his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all conversation with him.

But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me. My friend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part. A friend therefore is a sort of paradox in nature. I who alone am, I who see nothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own, behold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety and curiosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature. The other elelnent of friendship is tenderness. We are holden tCI men by every sort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre, by lust, by hate, by admiration, by every circumstance and badge and trifle-but we can scarce believe that so much char :l30 FRIENDSHIP acter can subsist in another as to draw us by love. Can another be so blessed and we so pure that we can offer him tenderness? When a man becomes dear to me I have touched the goal of fortune. I find '(!ery litt1e written directly to the heart of this matter in books. And yet I have one text which I cannot choose but remem- ber. My author says-\"! offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I effectually am, and tender myself least to him to whom I am the most devoted.\" I wish that friendship should have feet, as well as eyes and eloquence. It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults over the mOOD.

It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults over the mOOD. I wish it to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub. \\Ve chide the citizen because he makes love a commodity. It is an exchange of gifts, of useful loans ; it is good neighbol hood; it watches with the sick; it holds the pall at the funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of the relation. Bnt though we cannot find the god under this dis .. guise of a sutler I yet on the other hand we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread too fine and does not substantiate his romance by the Hlunicipal virtues of justice, punctuality, fidelity a.nd pity. I hate the prostitution of the name of friendship to sig.\" nify modish and worldly alliances. I much prefer the company of ploughboys and tIn-peddlers to the silken and perfumed amity which celebrates its days of encounter by a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle and dinners at the best taverns. The end of friendship is a comrnerce the most strict and homely that can be joined; more strict tban any of which we have experience. It is ~or aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life a.nd death. It is fit for .serene days and graceful gifts and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, pov- erty and persecution.

It :b \"eps company with the sallies of the wit and the trances of religion. Vl e are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of man's life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity. It should never fall into something usual and settled, but should be alert and inventive and add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery. Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so well tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circurnstanced (for even in that particular, a poet says, love ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 23 1 demands that the parties be altogether paired), that its satisfac .. tion can very seldom be assured. It cannot subsist in its ;>erfec .. tion, say sonle of those who are learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two. I am not quite so strict in my terms> perhaps because I have never known so high a fellowship as others. I please my imagination more with a circle of god-like men and women variously related to each other and between whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of one to one peremptory for conversation, which is the practice and c:on .. sumrnation of friendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good a.nd bad. You shall have very useful and cheer .. ing discourse at several tilnes with two several men, but let all three of you come together and you shall not have one new and hearty word. 1''\\I\\''0 may talk and one may hear, but three canno1' take part in a conversation of the most sincere", "useful and cheer .. ing discourse at several tilnes with two several men, but let all three of you come together and you shall not have one new and hearty word. 1''\\I\\''0 may talk and one may hear, but three canno1' take part in a conversation of the most sincere and searchin~ sort. In good company there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes place when you leave them alone. In good company the individuals merge their egotism into a social soul exactly co-extensi ve with the several consciousnesses there present. No partialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to sister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he may then speak who can sail on the com .. man thought of the party, and 110t poorly lhnited to his own. NoV\\\" this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the high freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute run- ning of two souls into one. No two men but being left alone with each other enter into simpler relations. Yet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse. Unrelated men give little joy to each other, will never suspect the latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation, as if it were a permanent property in sonle individuals. ConverRation is an evanescent relation-no more. A n1an is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he can .. not, for all that, say a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with a.s much reason as they would blame the insignifi- cance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it will mark the hour A.mong those who enjoy his thought he will regain his tongue. FRIENDSHIP Friendship requires that", "to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with a.s much reason as they would blame the insignifi- cance of a dial in the shade. In the sun it will mark the hour A.mong those who enjoy his thought he will regain his tongue. FRIENDSHIP Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and un- likeness that piques each with the presence of power and of con ... sent in the other party. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that my friend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I am equally balked by antagonism and by 'compliance. Let him not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is that the not mine is mine. I hate, where I looked for a manly furtherance or at least a manly resist- ance, to find a mush of concession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo. The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it. That high office requires great and sublime parts. There must be very two, before there can be very one. Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet they recognize the deep identity which, beneath these disparities, unites them. He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure that greatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to intermeddle with his fortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this.

Friendship demands a reli- gious treatment. We talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected. Reverence is a great part of it. Treat your friend as a spectacle. Of course he has merits that are not yours, and that you cannot honor if you must needs hold him close to your per- son. Stand aside; give those merits room; let them mount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend's buttons, or of his thought? To a great heart he will be a stranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come near in the holiest ground. Leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property, and to suck a short and all-confounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit. Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why insist on rash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his house, or know his mother and brother and sisters( \\Vby be visited by him at your own? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this touching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 233 I want, but not news, nor pottage. I can get politics and chat and neighborly conveniences from cheaper companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure, universal and great as nature itself?

There is at least this satisfaction in crime, according to the Latin proverb-you can speak to your accomplice on even terms. Crimen quos inquinat, cequat. To those whom we admire and love, at first we cannot. Yet the least defect of self-possession vitiates, in my judgment, the entire relation. There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never mutual respect, until in their dialogue each stands for the whole world. What is so great as friendship, let us carry with what gran- deur of spirit we can. Let us be silent-so we may hear the whis- per of the gods. Let us not interfere. Who set you to cast about what you should say to the select souls, or how to say any thing to such? No matter how ingenious, no matter how graceful and bland.

We see the noble afar off and they repel us; why should we intrude? Late-very late-we perceive that no arrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of society would be of any avail to establish us in such relations with them as we desire-but solely the uprise of nature in us to the same degree it is in them; then shall we meet as water with water; and if we should not meet them then, we shall not want them, for we are already they. In the last analysis, love is only the reflection of a man's own worthiness from other men. Men have sometimes exchanged names with their friends, as if they would signify that in their friend each loved his own soul. The higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy to establish it with flesh and blood. We walk alone in the world. Friends such as we desire are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope cheers ever the faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the universal power, souls are now acting, endur- :ng and daring, which can love us and which we can love. We may congratulate ourselves that the period of nonage, of faI- lles, of blunders and of shame, is passed in solitude, and when we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands in heroic hands.

I cannot afford to speak much with my friend. If he is great he makes me so great that I cannot descend to con- verse. In the 'great days, presentiments hover before me in the firmament. I ought then to dedicate myself to them. I go in that I may seize theIn, I go out that I may seize them. I fear only that I may lose them receding into the sky in which now they are only a patch of brighter light. Then, though I prize my friends, I can- not afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose my own.

My prudence consists in avoiding and going without, not in the inventing of means and methods, not in adroit steering, not in gentle repairing. I have no skill to make money 'spend well, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees my garden discovers that I must have some other garden. Yet I love facts, and hate lubricity and people without perception. Then 1 have the same title to write on prudence that I have to write on poetry or holiness. We write from aspiration and anta .. gonism, as well as from experience. We paint those qualities which we do not possess.

We paint those qualities which we do not possess. The poet admires the man of energy and tactics; the merchant breeds bis son for the church or the. bar; and where a man is not vain and egotistic you shall find what he has not by his praise. Moreover it would be hardly honest in me not to balance these fine lyric words of Love and Friend- ship with words of coarser sound, and whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant, not to own it in passing. Prudence is the virtue of the senses a It is the science of appear- ancesa It is the outmost action of the inward life .. It is God taking thought for oxen. It moves matter after the laws of matter .. It i&, content to seek health of body by complying with physical con- \u2022 ditions, and health of mind by the laws of the intellect. The world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not exist for itself, but has a symbolic character; and a true prudence or la,v of shows recognizes the co-presence of other laws and knows PRUDENCE that its own office is subaltern; knows that it is surface and not centre where it works. Prudence is false when detached. It is legitimate when it is the Natural History of the soul incarnate, when it unfolds the beauty of laws within the narrow scope of the senses.

One class live to the utility of the symbol, esteeming health and wealth a final good. Another class live above this mark to the beauty of the sjmbol, as the poet and artist and the naturalist and nlan of science. A third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified; these are wise men. The first class have common sense; the second, taste; and the third, spiritual perception. Once in a long time, a man traverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly, then also has a clea.r eye ~or its beauty, and lastly, whilst he pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature, does not offer to build houses and barns thereon-reverencing the splendor of the God which he sees bursting through each chink and cranny. The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of of a base prudence, which is a devotion to matter, as if we pos- sessed no other faculties than the palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a prudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never subscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends, and asks but one question of any project-Will it bake bread? This is a disease like a thickening of the skin until the vital organs are destroyed. But culture, revealing the high origin of the apparent world and aiming at the perfection of the man at the end, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily life, into means.

Cul- tivated men always feel and speak. so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of a civil or social measure, gteat personal influence, a graceful and commanding address, had their value as proofs of the energy of the spirit. If a man lose his balance and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but he is not a cultivated man. ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 239 The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god ot sots and cowards, and is the subject of all comedy. It is nature's joke, and therefore literature's. The true prudence limits this sensualism by adnlitting the knowledge of an internal and real world. This recognition once made, the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and times, being studied with the co- perception of their subordinate place, will reward any degree of attention. For our existence, thus apparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods which they mark-so susceptible to climate and to country, so alive to social good and evil, so fond of splendor and so tender to hunger and cold and debt-reads all its primary lessons out of these books. Prudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is. It takes the laws of the world whereby man's being is conditioned, as they are, and keeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good.

It takes the laws of the world whereby man's being is conditioned, as they are, and keeps these laws that it may enjoy their proper good. It respects space and time, climate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and death. There revolve, to give bound and period to his being on all sides, the sun and moon, the great formalists in the sky: here lies stubborn matter, and will not swerve from its chemical routine. Here is a planted globe, pierced and belted with natural laws and fenced and distributed ex- ternally with civil partitions and properties which impose new restraints on the young inhabitant. We eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by the air which blows around us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too hot, too dry or too wet. Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible and divine in its coming, is slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A door is to be painted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood or oil, or meal or salt; the house smokes1 or I have a headache; then the tax, and an affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains, and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very awkvlard word-these eat up the hours. Do what we can, summer will have its flies; if we walk in tht woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing we must expect a wet coat.

The hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day at will. At night he may sleep on a mat under the moon, and wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without a prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal. The northerner is perforce a householder. He must brew, bake, salt and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But as it hap- pens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some new acquaintance with nature, and as nature is inexhaustibly signifi- cant, the inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner in force. Such is the value of these matters that a man who knows other things can never know too much of these. Let him have accurate perceptions. Let him, if he have hands, handle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry, natural history and economics; the more he has, the less is he willing to spare anyone. Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action.

Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action. The domestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces which others never dream of. The application of means to ends insures victory and the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or of war. The good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of fruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the Department of State. In the rainy day he builds a work-bench, or gets his tool-box set in the corner of the barn- chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver and chisel. Herein he tastes an old joy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses and corn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping. His garden or his poultry- yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes. One might find argu- ment for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine ele- ment of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world.

On the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence .. If you think the senses final, obey their law. If you believe in the soul, do not clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect. It is vinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and imperfect perception. Dr. Johnson is reported to have said-\"lf the child says he looked out of this window, when he looked out of that-whip him.\" Our American character is marked by a more than average delight in accurate perception, which is shown by the currency of the byword, \"No mistake.\" But the discomfort of unpunctuality, of confusion of thought about facts, inattention to the wants of to .. morrow, is of no nation. The beautiful laws of time and space, once dislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the hive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey it will yield us bees. Our words and actions to be fair must be timely. A gay and pleasant sound is the whetting of the scythe in the mornings of June, yet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a whetstone or mower's rifle when it is too late in the season to make hay? Scat .. ter-brained and \"afternoon\" men spoil much more than their own affair in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them.

This property is the hitting, in all the figures we draw, the right centre of gravity. 1 mean the placing the figures firm upon their feet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on the spot where they should look. Even lifeless figures, as vessels and stools-let them be drawn ever so correctly-lose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their centre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and oscillating appearance. The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only great affecting pi~ture which I have seen) is the quietest 242 PRUDENCE and most passionleds piece you can imagine; a couple of saints who worship the Virgin and Child. Nevertheless it awakens a deeper impression than the contortions of ten crucified martyrs. For beside all the resistless beauty of form, it possesses in the highest degree the property of the perpendicularity of all the figures.\" This perpendicularity we demand of all the figures in this picture of life.

There is a certain fatal dislocation in our relation to nature, dis- torting our modes of living and making every law our enemy, which seems at last to have aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of Reform. We must call the highest prudence to counsel, and ask why health and beauty and genius 3hould now be the exception rather than the rule of human nature? We do not know the properties of plants and animals and the laws of nature, through our sympathy with the same; but this remains the dream of poets. Poetry and prudence should be coincident. Poets should be lawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide and insult, but should announce and lead the civil code and the day's work. But now the two things seem irreconcilably parted. We have violated law upon law until we stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a coincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are surprised. Beauty should be the dowry of every man and woman, as invariably as sensation; but it is rare. Health or sound organization should be universal. Genius should be the child of genius and every child should be inspired ~ but now it is not to be predicted of any child, and nowhere is it pure.

These use their gift to refine luxury, not to abolish ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 24.3 it. Genius is always ascetic, and piety, and love. Appetite shows to the fIner souls as a disease, and they find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it. We have found out fine naines to cover our sensuality withal, but no gifts can raise intemperance. The man of talent affects to call his transgressions of the la,vs of the senses trivial and to count them nothing considered with his devotion to his art. His art never taught him lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the wish to reap where he had not sowed. His art is less for every deduc ... tion from his holiness, and less for every defect of common sense. On him who scorned the world, as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge. He that despiseth small things will perish by little and little. Goethe's Tasso is very likely to be a pretty fair historic portrait, and that is true tragedy.

It does not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard the Third op- presses and slays a score of innocent persuns, as when Antonio dnd Tasso, both apparently right, wrong each other. One living after the maxims of this world and consistent and true to them, the other fired with all divine sentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without submitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel, a knot we cannot untie. Tasso's is no unfrequent case in modern biography. A man of genius, of an ardent tern ... perament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent, becomes pres .. ently unfortunate, querulous, a \"discomfortable cousin,\" a thorl'\" to himself and to others. The scholar shames us by his bifold life. 'Vhilst something higher than prudence is active, he is admirable; when comlnon sense is wanted, he is an encumbrance. Yesterday, Cresar was not \"~O great; to-day, the felon at the gallows' foot is not more miser- able.

Is it not better that a man should accept the first pains and mortifications of this sort, which nature is not slack in sending him, as hints that be must expect no other good than the just fruit of his own labor and self-denial? Health, bread, climate, social position, have their importance, and he will give them their due. Let him esteem Nature a perpetual counsellor, and her perfec- tions the exact measure of our deviations. Let him make the night night, and the day day. Let him control the habit of expense. Let him see that as much wisdom may be expended on a private econ- omy as on an empire, and as much wisdom may be drawn from it. The laws of the world are written out for him on every piece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will not be the better for knowing, were it only the wisdom of Poor Richard, or the State-Street prudence of buying by the acre to sell by the foot; or the thrift of the agriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because it will grow whilst he sleeps; or the prudence which con- sists in husbanding little strokes of the tool, little portions of time, particles of stock and small gains. The eye of prudence may never shut. Iron, if kept at the ironmonger's, win rust; beer, if l10t brewed in the right state of the atmosphere, will sour; timber of ships will rot at sea, or if laid up high and dry, will strain, warp and dry-rot; money, if kept by us, yields no rent", "never shut.

Strike, says the smith, the iron is white; keep the rake, says the haymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and the cart as nigh the rake. Our Yankee trade is reputed to be very nluch on the extreme of this prudence. It takes bank-notes, good, bad, clean, ragged, and saves itself by the speed with which it passes ~hem off. Iron cannot rust, nor beer sour, nor timber rot, nor calicos go out of fashion, nor money stocks depreciate, in the few swift moments in which the Yankee suffers anyone of them to remain in his possession. In skating over thin ice our safety is in our speed. Let him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him learn that ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 245 every thing in nature, even -motes and feathers, go by law and not by luck, and that what he sows he reaps.

Let him not make his fellow-creatures wait. How many words and promises are promises of conversation! Let his be words of fate. When he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float round the globe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for which it was written, amidst a swarming population, let him likewise feel the admoni- tion to integrate his being across all these distracting forces, and keep a slender human word among the storms, distances and accidents that drive us hither and thither, and, by persistency, make the paltry force of one man reappear to redeem its pledge after months and years in the most distant climates. We must not try to write the laws of anyone virtue, looking at that only. Human nature loves no contradictions, but is sym- metrical. The prudence which secures an outward well-being is not to be studied by one set of men, whilst heroism and holiness are studied by another, but they are reconcilable. Prudence con- cerns the present time, persons, property and existing forms. But as every fact hath its roots in the soul, and if the soul were changed would cease to be, or would become some other thing- the proper administration of outward things will always rest on ~ just apprehension of their cause and origin; that is, the good man will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the politic man. Every violation of 1 ruth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society.

Every violation of 1 ruth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society. On the most profit .. able lie the course of events presently lays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites frankness, puts the parties on a con .. venient footing and makes their business a friendship. Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they wiU show themselves great, though they make an exception in your favor to all th~ir rules of trade. So in rrgard to disagreeable and formidable things, prudence does 'not consist in evasion or in flight, but in courage. He wh.o PRUDENCE wishes to walk in the most peaceful parts of life with any serenit~ must screw himself up to resolution. Let him front the object ot his worst apprehension, and his stoutness will commonly make his fear groundless. The Latin proverb says, \"In battles the eye io first overcome.\" Entire self-possession Inay make a battle very little more dangerous to life than a match at foils or at football. Examples are cited by soldiers of men who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire given to it, and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball. The terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlor and the cabin. The drover, the sailor, buffets it all day, and his health renews itself at as vigorous a pulse under the sleet as under the sun of June.

Far off, men swell, bully and threaten; bring them hand to hand, and they are a feeble folk.. It is a proverb that 'courtesy costs nothing;' but calculation might come to value love for its profit. Love is fabled to be blind, but kindness is necessary to perception; love is not a hood, but aLl eye-water. If you meet a sectary or a hostile partisan, never rec- ognize the dividing lines, but meet on what common ground remains-if only that the sun shines and the rain rains for both; the area will widen very fast, and ere you know it, the boundary mountains on which the eye had fastened have melted into air.

Mahomet .. IN THE elder English dramatists, and mainly in the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, there is a constant recognition of gen\u00b7 tility, as if a noble behavior were as easily marked in the society of their age as color is in our American population. When any Rodrigo, Pedro or Valerio enters, though he be a stranger, the duke or governor exclaims, 'This is a gentleman'-and proffers civilities without end; but all the rest are slag and refuse. In harmony with this delight in personal advantages there is in their plays a certain heroic cast of character and dialogue-as in Bon ... duca, Sophocles, the Mad Lover, the Double Marriage-wherein the speaker is so earnest and cordial and on such deep grounds of character, that the dialogue, on the slightest additional in- cident in the plot, rises naturally into poetry. Among many texts take the following. The Roman Martius has conquered Athens- all but the invincible spirits of Sophocles, the duke of Athens, and Dorigen, his wife. The beauty of the latter inflames 1Iartius, and he seeks to save her husband; but Sophocles will not ask his life, although assured that a word will save him1 and the execu .. tiOD of both proceeds:- 249 HEROISM Valerius.

I do not readily remember any poem, play, sermon, novel or oration that our press vents in the last few years, which goes to the same tune. We have a great many fiutes and flageolets, but not often the sound of any fife. Yet Wordsworth's '<Laodamia,\" and the ode of \"Dian,\" and some sonnets, have a certain noble music; and Scott will sometiInes draw a stroke like the portrait of Lord Evandale given by Balfour of Burley. Thomas Carlyle~ with his natural taste for what is rpanly and daring in character, has suffered no heroic trait in his favorites to drop from his biographical and historical pictures. Earlier, Robert Burns has given us a song or two. In the Harleian Miscellanies there is an account of the battle of Lutzen which deserves to be read. And Simon Ockley's History of the Saracens recounts the prodigies of individual valor, with admiration all the more evident on the part of the narrator that he seems to think that his place in", "Harleian Miscellanies there is an account of the battle of Lutzen which deserves to be read.

To him we owe the Brasidas, the Dian, the Epaminondas, the Scipio of old, and I must think we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the ancient writers. Each of his \"Lives\" is a refutation to the despondency and cowardice of our religious and political theorists. A wild courage, a Stoicism not of the schools but of the blood, shines in every anecdote, and has given that boole its immense falne. We need books of this tart cathartic virtue more than books HEROISM of political science or of private economy. Life is a festival only to the wise. Seen from the nook and chimney-side of prudence, it wears a ragged and dangerous front. The violations of the laws of nature by our predecessors and our contemporaries are l?unished in us also. The disease and deformity around us certify the infraction of natural, intellectual and moral laws, and often violation on violation to breed such compound misery. A lock- jaw that bends a man's head back to his heels; hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes; insanity that makes him eat grass; war, plague, cholera, famine, indicate a certain ferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime, nlust have its outlet by human suffering: Unhappily no man ~xists who has not", "heels; hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes; insanity that makes him eat grass; war, plague, cholera, famine, indicate a certain ferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime, nlust have its outlet by human suffering: Unhappily no man ~xists who has not in his own person become to some amount ,t stockholder in the sin, and so made himself liable to a share \\n 1 ne expiation. ()ur culture therefore must not omit the arming of the man. Let bim hear in season that he is born into the state of war, and that the commonwealth and his own well-being require that he ~hould not go dancing in the weeds of peace, but warned, self-collected and neither defying nor dreading the thunder, let him take both reputation and life in his hand, and with perfect ~llrbanity dare the gibbet and the mob by the absolute truth of his speech and the rectitude of his behavior. Towards all this external evil the man within the breast: assumes a warlike attitude, and affirms his ability to cope single- handed with the infinite army of enemies. To this military atti- tude of the soul we give the name of Heroism. Its rudest form is the contempt for safety and ease, which makes the attractive- ness of war. It is a self-trust which slights the restraints of prudence, in the plenitude of its energy and power to repair the harms it may suffer.

There is somewhat not philosophical in heroism; there is somewhat not holy in it; it seems not to know that other souls are of one texture with it; it has pride; it is the extreme of individual ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 253 nature. Nevertheless we must profoundly revere it. There is somewhat in great actions '\\vhich does not allow us to go behind them. Heroism feels and never reasons, and therefore is always right; and although a different breeding, different religion and greater intellectual activity would have modified or even reversed the particular action, yet for the hero that thing he does is the highest deed, and is not open to the censure of philosophers or divines. It is the avowal of the unschooled man that he finds a quality in him that is negligent of expense, of health, of life, of danger, of hatred, of reproach, and knows that his will is higher and more excellent than all actual and all possible antag ... onists. - Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in contradiction, for a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual's character. Now to no other man can its wisdom appear as it does to him, for every man must be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than anyone else. Therefore just and wise men take umbrage at his act, until after some little time be past; then they see it to be in unison with their acts. AI]", "to him, for every man must be supposed to see a little farther on his own proper path than anyone else. Therefore just and wise men take umbrage at his act, until after some little time be past; then they see it to be in unison with their acts. AI] prudent men see that the action is clean contrary to a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its contempt of some external good. But it finds its own success at last, and then the prudent also extol. Self-trust is the essence of heroism. It is the state of the soul at war, and its ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and wrong, and the power to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents. It speaks the truth and it is just, gen ... erous, hospitable, temperate, scornful of petty calculations and scornful of being scorned. It persists; it is of an undaunted bold- ness and of a fortitude not to be wearied out. Its jest is the littleness of common life. That false prudence which dotes on health and wealth is the butt and merriment of heroism. Heroism\" like Plotinus, is almost ashamed of its body.

Yet the little man takes the great hoax so inno- cently, works in it so headlong and believing, is born red, and dies gray, arranging his toilet, attending on his own health, laying traps for sweet food and strong wine, setting his heart on a horse or a rifle, made happy with a little gossip or a little praise, that the great soul cannot choose but laugh at such earnest nonsense. \"Indeed, these humble considerations make me out of love with greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to take note how many pairs of silk stockings thou hast, namely, these and those that were the peach-colored ones; or to bear the in .. ventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and one other for usel\" Citizens, thinking after the laws of arithmetic, consider the inconvenience of receiving strangers at their fireside, reckon narrowly the loss of time and the unusual display; the soul of a better quality thrusts back the unseasonable economy into the vaults of life, and says, I will obey the God, and the sacrifice and the fire he will provide. Ibn Haukal, the Arabian geographer, describes a heroic extreme in the hospitality of Sogd, in Buk .. haria. \"When I was in Sogd I saw a great building, like a palace, the gates of which were open and fixed back to the wall with iarge nails. I asked the reason, and was told that the house had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred years. Strangers may present themselves at any hour and in whatever number; the master has amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals, and is never happier than when they tarry", "and was told that the house had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred years. Strangers may present themselves at any hour and in whatever number; the master has amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals, and is never happier than when they tarry for some time. Nothing of the kind have I seen in any other country.\" The magnanimous know very well that they who give time, or money, or shelter, to the stranger-so it be done for love and not for ostentation-do, as it were, put God under obligation to them, so perfect are the compensations of the universe. In some way the time they seem to lose is redeemed and the pains they seem to take remunerate themselves. These men fan the flame of human love and raise the standard of civil virtue among mankind. But hospitality must be for service ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES and not for show, or it pulls down the bast. The brave soul rate: itself too high to value itself by the splendor of its table and draperies. It gives what it hath, and all it hath, but its own majesty can lend a better grace to bannocks and fair ,\\\\7ater than belong to city feasts. The temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no dishonor to the worthiness he has. But he loves it for its elegancy, not for its austerity. It seems not worth his whil,! to be solelnn and denounce with bitterness flesh-eating or wine- drinking, the use of tobacco, or opium, or tea, or silk, or gold.

It is told of Brutus, that when he fell on his sword after the battle of Philippi, he quoted a line of Euripides-\"O Virtue! I have followed thee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade.\" I doubt not the hero is slandered by this report. The heroic soul does not sell its justice and its nobleness .. It does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep warm. The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough. Poverty is its ornament. It does not need plenty, and can very well abide its loss. But that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class, is the good-humor and hilarity they exhibit. It is a height to which common duty can very well attain, to suffer and to dare with solemnity. But these rare souls set opinion, success, and life at so cheap a rate that they will not soothe their enemies by petitions, or the show of sorrow, but wear their own habitual greatness.

The great will not condescend to take any thing seriously; all must be as gay as the song of a canary, though it were the building of cities or the eradication of old and foolish churches and nations which have cumbered the earth long thousands of years. Simple hearts put all the history and customs of this world behind them, and play their own game in innocent defiance of the Blue-Laws of the world; and such would appear, could we see the human race assembled in vision, like little children frolicking together, though to the eyes of mankind at large they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and influences ..

All these great and transcendent properties are ours. If we dilate in beholding the Greek energy, the Roman 'Pride, it is that we are already domesticating the same senti- ment. Let us find room for this great guest in our small houses. The first step of worthiness will be to disabuse us of our super- -$titious associations with places and times, with number and -size.

The Jerseys were hand~ some ground enough for Washington to tread, and London streets for the feet of Milton. A great man makes his climate genial in the imagination of men, and its air the beloved element of all delicate spirits. That country is the fairest which is inhabited by the noblest minds. The pictures which fill the imagination in reading the actions of Pericles, Xenophon, Columbus, Bayard, Sidney, Hampden, teach us how needlessly mean our life is; that we, by the depth of our living, should deck it with more than regal or national splendor, and act on principles that should interest man and nature in the length of our days. We have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men. who never ripened, or whose performance in actual life was not extraordinary. When we see their air and mien, when we hear them speak of society, of books, of religion, we admire their superiority; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social state; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant who is sent to work revolutions. But they enter an active profession and the forming Colossus shrinks to the common size of man. The magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always make the Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its re- venge the moment they put their horses of the sun to plough in its furrow.

Or why should a woman liken herself to any historical woman, and think, because Sappho, or Sevigne, or De Stael, or the cloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation do not satisfy the imagination and the serene Themis, none can-certainly not she? Why not? She has a new and unattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest nature that ever bloomed.

There is no weakness or exposure for which we cannot find consolation in the thought-this is a part of my constitution,. part of my relation and office to my fellow-creature. Has nature covenanted with me that I should never appear to disadvantage, never make a ridiculous figure? Let us be generous of our dignity as well as of our money.

And not only need we breathe and exercise the soul by assuming the penalties of abstinence, of debt, of solitude, of unpopularity- but it behooves the wise man to look with a bold eye into those rarer dangers which sometimes invade men, and to familiarize hin1self with disgusting forms of disease, with sounds of execra .. tion, and the vision of violent death.

The Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the present, and the OIL\\Y prophet of that which must be, is that great na- ture in wbich we rest as the earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity, that Over-Soul, within which every man's particular being is contained and made one with all other; that common heart of which all sincere conversation is the worship, to which all right action is submission; that over- powering reality which confutes our tricks and talents, a,nd constrains e,'ery one to pass for what he is, and to speak from h;.is character and not from his tongue, and which evermoret'eiids to pass into our thought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power and beauty. We live in succession, in division. in parts, in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every pari and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE.

All goes to show that the soul in man is not an organ, but animates and exercises all the organs; is not a function, like the power of nlemory, of calculation, of comparison, but uses these as hands and feet; is not a faculty, but a light; is not the intellect or the will, but the master of the intellect and the will; is the background of our being, in which they lie-an im- mensity not possessed and that cannot be possessed. From within or frain behind, a light shines through us upan things and makes us aware that we are nothing, but the light is all. A man is the , fac;ade of a temple wherein all wisdom and all good abide. What we cOlnnl0nly call man, the eating, drinking, planting, count- ing lnan, does not, as we know hhn, represent himself, but mis- represents hin1self. Hinl we do not respect, but the soul, whose organ he is, would he let it appea.r through his action, would make our knees bend. When it breathes through his intellect\" it is genius; when it breathes through his will, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it is love.

'fhe weakness of the will begins when the individual would bit THE OVER-SOUL something of himself. All reform aims in some one particular to let the soul have its way through us; in other words, to engage us to obey. Of this pure nature every man is at some time sensible. Lan- guage cannot paint it with his colors. It is too subtile. It is un- definable, unmeasurable; but we know that it pervades and contains us. We know that all spiritual being is in man. A wise old proverb says, \"God comes to see us without bell;\" that is, as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the in- fini te heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul , where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins. The walls are taken away. We lie open on one side to the deeps of spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we f~e and know, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they tower over us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them. The sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made known by its independency of those limitations which circum- scribe us on every hand. The soul circumscribes all things. As I have said, it contradicts all experience. In like manner it abol- ishes time and space. The influence of the senses has in most men overpowered the mind to that degree that the walls of time and space have come to look real and insurn1ountable; and to speak with levity of these limits is, in the world, the sign of insanity.

The spirit sports with time- .' \"Can crowd eternity into an hour, \" Or stretch an hour to eternity.\" _ We are often made to feel that there is another youth and age than that which is measured from the year of our natural birth. Some thoughts always find us young, and keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the universal and eternal beauty. Every man parts from that contemplation with the feeling that it rather belongs to ages than to mortal life. The least activity !)f the intellectual powers redeems us in a degree from the :onditions of time. In sickness~ in languor, give us a strain of ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES poetry or a profound sentence, and we are refreshed; or pro ... duce a volume of Plato or Shakspeare, or remind us of their names, and instantly we come into a feeling of longevity. See how the deep divine thought reduces centuries and millenniums, and makes i tsel f present through all ages. Is the teaching of Christ less effective now than it was when first his mouth was opened? The elnphasis of facts and persons in my thought has nothing to do with time.

Before the revelations of the soul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away .. In common speech we refer all things to tin1e, as we habitually refer the immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere. And so we say that the Judgment is distant or near, that the lVlillen- nium approaches, that a day of certain political, moral, social reforms is at hand, and the like, when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we contemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is permanent and connate with the soul. The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by one, detach themselves like ripe fruit from our experience, and fall. The wind shall blow them none knows whither. The landscape, the figures, Boston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution past, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society, and so is the world.

With each divine inlpulse the mind rends the thin rinds 't of the visible and finite, and comes out into eternity, and in- i spires and expires its air. It l!onverses with truths that have always been spoken in the world, and becomes conscious of I a closer sympathy with Zeno and Arrian than with persons in . the house. This is the law of moral and of mental gain. The simple rise as by specific levity not into a particular virtue, but into the region of all the virtues. They are in the spirit which contains them all. The soul requires purity, but purity is not it; requires justice, but justice is not that; requires beneficence, but is some- what better; so that there is a kind of descent and accommoda- tion felt when we leave speaking of moral nature to urge a virtue } which it enjoins. To the well-born child all the virtues are nat- f ural, and not painfully acquired. Speak to his heart, and the \\. man becomes suddenly virtuous.

Speak to his heart, and the \\. man becomes suddenly virtuous. Within the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual growth, which obeys the same law. Those who are capable of humility, of justice, of love, of aspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the sciences and arts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso dwells in this moral beatitude already at lticipates those special powers which men prize so highly. The lover has no talent, no skill, which passes for quite nothing with his enamored maiden, however little she may possess of related faculty; and the heart which abandons itself to the Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works, and will travel a royal road to particular knowledges and powers. In ascending to this primary and aboriginal sentiment we have come from our remote station on the circumference instantaneously to the centre of the world, where, as in the closet of God, we see causes, and anticipate the universe, which is but a slow effect. One mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of the l;pirit in a form-in forms, like my own. I live in society; with persons who answer to thoughts in my own mind, or express a certain obedience to the great instincts to which I live. I see its presence to them.

Persons are supplenlen~ tary to the primary teaching of the soul. In youth Vtie are mad for persons. Childhood and youth see all the vlorld in them. But the larger experience of man discovers the identical nature appearing through them all. Persons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal. In all conversation between two persons tacit reference is made, as to a third party, to a common nature. Tha t third party or common nature is not social; it is imper- sonal; is God. And so in groups where debate is earnest, and especially on high questions, the company become aware that the thought rises to an equal level in all bosoms, that all have a spiritual property in what \\vas said, as well as the sayer. They all become wiser than they were. It arches over them like a temple, this unity of thought in which every heart . beats with nobler sense of power and duty, and thinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are conscious of attaining to a higher self-possession. It shines for all. There is a certain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the lowest, and which our ordinary education often labors to silence and obstruct. The mind is one, and the best minds, who love truth for its own sake, think much less of property in truth ..

They accept it thankfully everywhere, and do not label or stamp it with any man's name, for it is theirs long beforehand, and from eternity. The learned and the studious of thought have no monopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some degree disqualifies them to think truly. We owe many val- uable observations to people who are not very acute or pro- found, and who say the thing without effort which we want and have long been hunting in vain. The action of the soul is ' {)ftener in that which is felt and left unsaid than in that which is sa5d in any conversation. It broods over every society, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other. We know better than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know at \"the same time that we are much nlore.

But if I renounce my will and act for the soul, set- ting that up as umpire between us two, out of his young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves with me. The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when he see it, let sceptic and scoffer say what they choose. !Foolish people ask you, when you have spoken what they do ;lot wish to hear, '\"How do you know it is truth, and not an error of your own?' We know truth when we see it, from opinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake. It was a grand sentence of Emanuel Swedenborg, which would alone in ... llicate the greatness of that man's perception-\"It is no proof of a man's understanding to be able to affirm whatewver he pleases; but to be able to discern that what is true is true, and that what is false is false-this is the mark and character of in .. telligence.\" In the book I read, the good thought returns to me, as every truth will, the image of the whole soul.

And here we should seek to reinforce ourselves by its very presence and to speak with a worthier, loftier strain of that advent.

We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifesta ... tions of its own nature, by the term Revelation. These are always attended by the emotion of the sublime. For this com- munication is an influx of the Divine mind into our mind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet before the flowing surges of the sea of life. Every distinct apprehension of this central com- mandment agitates men with awe and delight.

Every distinct apprehension of this central com- mandment agitates men with awe and delight. A thrill passes through all men at the reception of new truth, or at the per- formance of a great action, which comes out of the heart of nature. In these communications the power to see is not sepa- rated from the will to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and the obedience proceeds from a joyful per- ception. Every moment when the individual feels himself in- vaded by it is memorable. By the necessity of our constitution a certain enthusiasm attends the individual's consciousness of that divine presence. The character and duration of this enthu- siasm vary with the state of the individual, from an ecstasy and trance and prophetic inspiration-which is its rarer appearance -to the faintest glow of virtuous emotion, in which form it warms, like our household fires, all the families and associa- tions of men, and makes society possible. A certain tendency to insanity has always attended the opening of the religious sense in men, as if they had been \"blasted with excess of light.\" The trances of Socrates, the \"union\" of Plotinus, the vision oi Porphyry, the conversion of Paul, the aurora of Behmen, the convulsions of George Fox and his Quakers, the illumination of Swedenborg, are of this kind.

The rapture of the Moravian and Quietist; the opening of the Ifternal sense of the Word, in the language of the New Jerusalenl Church; the revi~al of the Calvinistic churches; the experiences J)f the l\\tlethodists, are varying forms of that shudder of awe and delight with which the individual soul al\\vays mingles with the universal soul. The nature of these revelations is the same; they are per- . ceptions of the absolute law. They are solutions of the soul's own questions. They do not answer the questions which the understanding asks. The soul answers never by words, but by _ the thing itself that is inquired after. Revelation is the disclosure of the soul. The popular notion of a revelation is that it is a telling of fortunes .. In past oracles of the soul the understanding seeks to find answers to sensual ques .. tions, and undertakes to tell from God how long men shall exist, what their 1.ands shall do and who shall be their company, adding names and dates and places. But we must pick no locks. We nlust check this low curiosity .. An answer in words is delusive; it is really no answer to the questions you ask. Do not require a description of the countries towards which you sail. The description does not describe them to you, and to- morrow you arrive there and know them by inhabiting them. Men ask concerning the immortality of the soul, the employ- ments of heaven, the state of the sinner, and so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left replies to precisely these inter- rogatories.

Men ask concerning the immortality of the soul, the employ- ments of heaven, the state of the sinner, and so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left replies to precisely these inter- rogatories. Never a moment did that sublime spirit speak in their patois. To truth, justice, love, the attributes of the soul, the idea of immutableness is essentially associated. Jesus, living in these moral sentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes, heeding only the manifestations of these, never made the separation of the idea of duration from the essence of these attributes, nor uttered a syllable concerning the duration of the soul. It was left to his disciples to sever duration from the moral elements, and to teach the immortality of the soul as a doctrine, and main- tain it by evidences. The moment the doctrine of the imn1or\u00b7\u00b7 ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES tality is separately taught, man is already fallen. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility, there is no question of continuance. No inspired man ever asks this question or con- descends to these evidences. For the soul is true to itself. and , the man in whom ~t is shed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is infinite, to a future which would be finite. , These questions ,vhich we lust to ask about the future are a confession of sin. God bas no answer for them. No answer in words can reply to a question of things.

The only mode of obtaining an answer to these questions of the senses is to forego all low curiosity, and, ac- cepting the tide of being which floats us into the secret of nature, work and live, ,\",lork and live, and all unawares the ad- vancing soul has built and forged for itself a new condition, and the question and the answer are one. By the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which burns until it shall dissolve all things into the waves and surges of an ocean of light, we see and know each other, and what spirit each is of. \\Vho can tell the grounds of his knowledge of the character of the several individuals in his circle of friends? No man. Yet their acts and words do not disappoint him. In that man, though he knew no ill of him, he put no trust.

Against their will they exhibit those decisive trifles by which character is read. But who judges? and what? Not our understanding. We do not read them by learning or craft. No; the wisdoln of the wise man consists herein, that he does not judge them; he lets them judge them- selves and merely reads and records their own verdict. By virtue of this inevitable nature, private will is overpow .. ered, and, maugre our efforts or our imperfections, your genius will speak from you, and mine from me. That which we are, we shall teach, not voluntarily but involuntarily. Thoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open, and thoughts go out of our minds through avenues which we never I voluntarily opened. Character teaches over our head.

The tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having is another. The great distinction between teachers sacred or literary- between poets like Herbert, and poets like Pope-between phi ... losophers like Spinoza, Kant and Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley, Mackintosh and Stewart-between men of the world who are reckoned accomplished talkers, and here and there a fervent mystic, prophesying half insane under the in- finitude of his thought-is that one class speak from within, or from experience, as parties and possessors of the fact; and the other class from without, as spectators merely, or perhaps as acquainted with the fact on the evidence of third persons. It is of no use to preach to me from without. I can do that too easily myself. Jesus speaks always from within, and in a de- gree that transcends all others. In that is the miracle. I believe ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES beforehand that it ought so to be. All men stand continually in the expectation of the appearance of such a teacher.

The same Omniscience flows into the intellect and makes what we call genius. Much of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most illuminated class of men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers. Among the multi- tude of scholars and authors we feel no hallowing presence; we are sensible of a knack and skill rather than of inspiration; they have a light and know not whence it comes and call it ~ their own; their talent is some exaggerated faculty, some over- t~ grown member, so that their strength is a disease. In these in- stances the intellectual gifts do not make the impression of virtue, but almost of vice; and we feel that a man's talents r stand in the way of his advancement in truth. But genius is/ religious. It is a larger imbibing of the common heart. It i~ not anomalous, but more like and not less like other men. There\\ is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity which is superior\\ to any talents they exercise. The author, the wit, the partisan, the fine gentleman, does not take place of the man. Humanity shines in HOlner, in Chaucer, in Spenser, in Shakspeare, in Miltop. They are content with truth. They use the positive de- gree. \"fhey seem frigid and phlegmatic to those who have been spiced with the frantic passion and violent coloring of inferior but popular writers.

The soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of its works. The .great poet makes us feel our own wealth~ and then we think less .of his compositions. His best communication to our mind is to teach us to despise all he has done. Shakspeare car- ries us to such a lofty strain of intelligent activity as to sug- gest a wealth which beggars his own; and we then feel that the splendid works which he has created, ana which in other hours we extol as a sort of self .. existent poetry, take no stronger hold of real nature than the shadow of a passing traveller on the 274 THE OVER-SOUL , rock. The inspiration which uttered itself in Hamlet and Lear could lItter things as good from day to day for eyer. \\Vhy then should I make account of Hamlet and Lear, as if we had not the soul from which they fell as syllables from the tongue? This energy does not descend into indi\" iduallife on any other condition than entire possession. It comes to the lowly and simple; it comes to whomsoever will put off what is foreign and proud; it comes as insight; it comes as serenity and grandeur.

From that inspiration the man comes back with a changed tone. He does not talk with men with an eye to their opinion. He tries them. It requires of us to be plain and true. The vain traveller attempts to embellish his life by quoting my lord and the prince and the countess, who thus said or did to him. The ambitious vulgar show you their spoons and brooches and rings, and preserve their cards and compli- ments. The more cultivated, in their account of their own ex- perience, cull out the pleasing, poetic circumstance-the visit to Rome, the man at genius they saw, the brilliant friend they know; still furtner on perhaps the gorgeous landscape, the mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they enjoyed yesterday -and so seek to throw a romantic color over their life. But the soul that ascends to worship the great God is plain and true; has no rose-color, no fine friends, no chivalry, no adventures; does not want admIration; dwells in the hour that now is, in the earnest experience of the common day-by reason of the present moment and the mere trifle having become porous to thought and bibulous of the sea of light. Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature j looks like word-catching. The simplest utterances are worthiest to be written, yet are they so cheap and so things of course, that in the infinite riches of the soul it is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or bottling a little air in a phial, when the whole earth and the whole atmosphere are ours.

ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 275 Souls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as gods in the earth, accepting without any admiration your wit, your bounty, your virtue even-say rather your act of duty, for your virtue they own as their proper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal, and the father of the gods. But what rebuke their plain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual flattery with which authors solace each other and wound themselves! These flatter not. I do not wonder that these men go to see Cromwell and Christina and Charles the Second and James the First and the Grand Turk. For they are, in their own elevation, the fellows of kings, and must feel the servile tone of conversation in the world. They must always be a godsend to princes, for they confront them, a king to a king, without ducking or concession, and give a high nature the refreshment and satisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of even companionship and of new ideas. They leave them wiser and superior men. Souls like these make us feel tha t sincerity is more excellent than flattery.

Before the immense possibilifies at man all mere experience, all past biography, how- ever spotless and sainted, shrinks away. Before that heaven which our presentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise any form of life we have seen or read of. We not only affirm that 'Vie have few great men, but, absolutely speaking, that we have none; that we have no history, no record of any character or mode of living that entirely contents us. The saints and demigods whom history worships we are constrained to accept with a grain of allowance. Though in our lonely hours we draw a new strength out of their memory, yet, pressed on our attention, as they are by the thoughtless and customary, they fatigue and in- vade. The soul gives itself, alone, original and pure, to the Lonely, Original and Pure, who, on that condition,- gladly in- habits, leads and speaks through it. Then is It glad, young and nimble: It is not wise, but it sees through all things. It is not called religious, but it is innocent.

Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that around every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but every end is a beginlling; that there is always an .. other dawn risen on mid-noon, and under every deep a lower deep opens. This fact, as far as it syulbolizes the moral fact of the Un\u00b7 attainable, the flying Perfect, around which the hands of man. can never meet, at once the inspirer and the condemner of every success, ma.y conveniently serve us to connect many illustrations of human power in every department. There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and \",olatile. Permanence is but a word of degrees. Our giobe seen by God is a transparent law, not a mass of facts. The law dis- solves the fact and holds it fluid. Our culture is the predomi- nance of an idea which draws after it this train of cities and institutions.

Our culture is the predomi- nance of an idea which draws after it this train of cities and institutions. Let us rise into another idea; they will disappear. The Greek sculpture is all melted away, as if it had been statues of ice; here and there a solitary figure or fragment remaining, 27Y CIRCLES as we see flecks and scraps of snow left in cold dells and mountain clefts in June and July. For the genius that created it creates now somewhat else. The Greek letters last a little longer, but are already passing under the same sentence .. and tumbling into the' Inevitable pit which the creation of new thought opens for all that is old. The new continents are built out of the ruins of an old planet; the new races fed out of the decomposition of the foregoing. New arts destroy the old. See \\he investment of capital in aqueducts, made useless by hydrau- lies; fortifications, by gunpowder; roads and canals, by rail- ways; sails, by steam; steam by electricity. You admire this tower of granite, weathering the hurts of so many ages. Yet a little waving hand built this huge wall, and that which builds is better than that which is built. The hand that built can topple it down much faster. Better than the hand and nimbler was the invisible thought which wrought through it; and thus ever, behind the coarse effect, is a fine cause, which, being narrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer cause. Everything looks permanent until its secret is known. A rich estate appears to women a firm and lasting fact; to a merchant, one easily created out of any materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good", "a fine cause, which, being narrowly seen, is itself the effect of a finer cause. Everything looks permanent until its secret is known. A rich estate appears to women a firm and lasting fact; to a merchant, one easily created out of any materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good tillage, good grounds, seem a fixture, like a gold mine, or a river, to a citizen; but to a large farmer, not much more fixed than the state of the crop. Nature looks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a cause like all the rest; and when once I comprehend that, will these fields stretch so immovably wide, these leaves hang so individually consid- erable? Permanence is a word of degrees. Every thing is medial. Moons are no more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls. The key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying though he look, he has a helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all his facts are classified. He can only be reformed by showing him a new idea 'which commands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving circle, which, from a ring imper- ceptibly small, rushes on all sides outwards to new and larger circles, and that without end. The extent to which this genera- tion of circles, wheel without wheel, will go, depends on the ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 28.1 force or truth of the individual soul. For it is the inert effort of each thought, having formed itself into a circular wave of circumstance-as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a local usage, a religious rite-to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify and hem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over that boundary on all", "formed itself into a circular wave of circumstance-as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a local usage, a religious rite-to heap itself on that ridge and to solidify and hem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it bursts over that boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on the great deep, which also runs up into a high wave, with attempt again to stop and to bind. But the heart refuses to be imprisoned; in its first and narrowest pulses it already tends outward with a vast force and to immense and innumerable .. expansIons. Every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series. Every general law only a particular fact of some more gene.ral law presently to disclose itself. There is no outside, no inclosing wall, no circumference to us. The man finishes his story- how good! how final! how it puts a new face on all things! He fills the sky. Lo! on the other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we had just pronounced the outline of the sphere. Then already is our first speaker not man, but only a first speaker. His only redress is forthwith to draw a circle outside of his antagonist. And so men do by them .. selves. The result of to-day, which haunts the mind and can ... not be escaped, will presently be abridged into a word, and the principle that seemed to explain nature will itself be included as one example of a bolder generalization. In the thought of to-morrow there is a power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted. Every man", "nature will itself be included as one example of a bolder generalization. In the thought of to-morrow there is a power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures of the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet depicted. Every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a suggestion of that he should be. Men walk as prophecies of the next age. Step by step we scale this mysterious ladder; the steps are actions, the new prospect is power. Every several result is threat ... ened and judged by that which follows. Every one seems to be contradicted by the new; it is only limited by the new. The ne~ statement is always hated by Jhe old, and, to those dwelling in the old, comes like an abyss of scepticism. But the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye and it are effects of one cause; then CIRCLES its innocency and benefit appear, and presently, all its energy ~pent, it pales and dwindles before the revelation of the new hour. Fear not the new generalization .. Does the fact look crass and material, threatening to degrade thy theory of spirit? Resist it not; it goes to refine and raise thy theory of matter just as much. There are no fixtures to men, if we appeal to consciousness. Every man supposes himself not to be fully understood; and if there is any truth in him, if he rests at last on the divine soul, 'J. see not how it can be otherwise. The last chamber, the last closet, he must feel was never opened; there is always a residuum unknown, unanalyzable. That is, every man believes that he has a greater possibility.

Our moods do not believe in each other. To-day I am full of thoughts and can write what I please. I see no reason why I should not have the same thought, the same power of expression, to-morrow. What I write, whilst I write it, seems the most natural thing in the world; but yesterday I saw a dreary vacuity in this direction in which now I see so much; and a month hence, I doubt not, I shall wonder who he was that wrote so many con- tinuous pages. Alas for this infirm faith, this will not strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow! I am God in nature; I am a weed by the wall. The continual effort to raise himself above himself, 'to work a pitch above his last height, betrays itself in a man's relations. We thirst for approbation, yet cannot forgive the approver. The sweet of nature is love; yet if I have a friend I am tormented by my imperfections. The love of me accuses the other party. If he were high enough to slight me, then could I love him, and rise by my affection to new heights. A man's growth is seen in the successive choirs of his friends. For every friend whom he loses for truth, he gains a better. I thought as I walked in the woods and mused on my friends, why should I play with them this game of idolatry?

Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet.. Then all things are at risk. It is as when a conflagration bas broken out in a great city, and no man knows what is safe, or where it will end. There is not a piece of science but its flank may be turned to-morrow; there is not any literary reputation, not the so-called eternal names of fame, that may not be re- Yised and condemned. The very hopes of man, the thought~ of his heart, the religion of nations, the manners and morals of mankind are all at the nlercy of a new generalization. Generaliza- tion is always a new influx of the divinity into the mind. Hence the thrill that attends it. \\Talor consists in the power of self-recovery, so that a maIl cannot have his flank turned, cannot be out-generalled, but put him where you will, he stands. This can only be by his pre' ferring truth to his past apprehension of truth, and his alert acceptance of it from whatever quarter; the intrepid convic tion that his laws, his relations to society, his Christianity, hi! world, may at any time be superseded and decease. There are degrees in idealism. We learn first to play with it CIRCLES ,academically, as the magnet was once a toy.

The idealism of Berkeley ls only a crude statement of the idealism of Jesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact that all nature is the rapid ,efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself. Much more Dbviollsly is history and the state of the world at anyone time directly dependent on the intellectual classification then exist- ing in the minds of men. The things which are dear to men at this hour are so on account of the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon, and which cause the present order of thil\\.gs, as a tree bears its apples. A new degree of culture would Instantly revolutionize the entire system of human pursuits. Conversation is a game of circles. In conversation we pluck up the termini which bound the common of silence on every side. The parties are not to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under this Pentecost. Tomorrow they will have receded from this high-water mark. To-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old pack-saddles. Yet let us enjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls.

In common hours, society sits cold and statuesque. We all stand waiting, empty- knowing, possibly, that we can be full, surrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to us, but prose and trivial toys. Then cometh the god and converts the statues into fiery men, .. and by a flash of his eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things, and the meaning of the very furniture, of cup and saucer, of chair and clock and tester, is manifest. The facts which loomed so large in the fogs of yesterday-property, cli- ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES mate, breeding, personal beauty and the like, have strangely changed their proportions. All that we reckoned settled shakes and rattles; and literatures, cities, climates, religions, leave their foundations and dance before our eyes. And yet here again see the swift circumscription! Good as is discourse, silence is better, and shames it. The length of the discourse indicates the distance of thought betwL~t the speaker and the hearer. If they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no words would be necessary thereon. If at one in all parts, no words would be suffered.

In like manner we see literature best from the midst of wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or from a high religion. The field cannot be well seen fronl within the field. The astron ... orner must have his diameter of the earth's orbit as a base to find the parallax of any star. Therefore we value the poet. All the argument and all the wisdom is Flat in the encyclopredia, or the treatise on metaphys- ics, or the Body of Divinity, but in the sonnet or the play. In my daily work I incline to repeat myoId steps, and do not believe in remedial force, in the power of change and reform .. But some Petrarch or Ariosto, filled with the new wine of his imagination, writes me an ode or a brisk romance, full of daring thought and action. He smites and arouses me with his shrill tones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and I open my eye on my own possibilities. He claps wings to the sides of all the solid old lumber of the world, and I am capable once more of choosing a straight path in theory and practice.

Cleansed by the eIe\u00b7. mental light and wind, steeped in the sea of beautiful forms 'which the field offers us, we nlay chance to cast a right glance back upon biography. Christianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind; yet was there never a young philosopher whose breed~ng had fallen into the Christian church by wholn that brave text of Paul's was not specially prized: \"Then shall also the Son be subject unto Him who put alJ things under him, that God may be all in all.\" Let the claims and virtues of per .. sons be never so great and welcome, the in~til1ct of nlan presses eagerly onward to the inlpersonal and illinlitable, and gladly arms itself against the doglnatisln of bigots with this generous word out of the book itself.

Has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft, who has explored the gravity of atoms and the elective affinities, who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate statement, namely that like draws to like, and that the goods which belong to you gravitate to you and need not be pursued with pains and cost? Yet is that statement approximate also, and not final. Omnipresence is a higher fact. Not through subtle subterranean channels need friend and fact be drawn to their counterpart, but, rightly con .. sidered, these things proceed from the eternal generation of the soul. Cause and effect are two sides of one fact. The same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues, and extinguishes each in the light of abetter. The great man will not be prudent in the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much deduction from his grandeur. But it behooves each to see, when he sacrifices prudence, to what god he devotes it; if to ease and pleasure, be had better be pru- ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES dent still; if to a great trust, he can well spare his mule and panniers who has a ',dnged chariot instead.

I suppose that the highest prudence is the lowest prudence. Is this too sudden a rushing from the centre to the verge of our orbit? Think how n1any times we shall fall back into pitiful calcula- tions before we take up our rest in the great sentiment, or make the verge of to-day the new centre. Besides, your bravest sentiment is familiar to the humblest men. The poor a.nd the low have their way of expressing the last facts of philosophy as well as you. \"Blessed be nothing\" and \"The worse things are, the better they are\" are proverbs which express the transcenden~ talism of common life. One man's justice is another's injustice; one man's beaut) another's ugliness; one man's wisdom another's folly~ as one behoids the same objects from a higher point.

I am not careful to justify myself.

Each becomes the other. Itself alone is. Its vision is not like the vision of the eye, but is union with the things known. Intellect and intellection signify to the common ear considera- tion of abstract truth. The consideration of time and place, of you and me, of profit and hurt, tyrannize over most men's minds. Intellect separates the fact considered, from you, from all local and personal reference, and discerns it as if it existed for its own sake. Heraclitus looked upon the affections as dense and colored mists. In the fog of good and evil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in a straight line .. Intellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the light of science, cool and disen- gaged.

He who is immersed in \\vbat concerns person or place cannot see the problem of existence. This the intellect always ponders. Nature shows all things formed and bound. The intellect pierces the form, overleaps the wall, detects intrinsic likeness between re- mote things and reduces all things into a few principles. The making a fact the subject of thought raises it. All that mass of mental and moral phenomena which we do not make objects of voluntary thought, come within the power of fortune; they constitute the circumstance of daily life; they are subject to change, to fear and hope. Every man beholds his human con- dition with a degree of melancholy ... :\u00ab\\s a ship aground is battered by the waves, so man, imprisoned in mortal life, lies open to the mercy of coming events. But a truth, separated by the intellect,_ is no longer a subject of destiny_ \\Ve behold it as a god upraised above care and fear. And so any fact in our life, or any record of our fancies or reflections, disentangled from the web of out unconsciousness, becomes an object impersonal and immortal .. It is the past restored, but embalmed. A better art than that of Egypt has taken fear and corruption out of it. It is eviscerated of care. It is offered for science. What is addressed to us for contemplation does Dot threaten us but makes us intellectual beings. The growth of the intellect is spontaneous in every expansion. The mind that grows could not predict the times, the means, the mode of that spontaneity. God enters by a private door into every individual.

The mind that grows could not predict the times, the means, the mode of that spontaneity. God enters by a private door into every individual. Long prior to the age of reflection is the thinking of the mind. Out of darkness it came insensibly into the marvellour light of to-day. In the period of infancy it accepted and disposed of all impressions from the surrounding creation after its own way. Whatever any mind doth or saith is after a law, and this native law remains over it after it has come to reflection or con- scious thought. In the most worn, pedantic, introverted self- tormentor's life, the greatest part is incalculable by him, unfore- seen, unimaginable, and must be, until he can take himself up by his own ears. What am I? What has my will done to make me that I am? Nothing. I have been floated into this thought INTELLECT this hour, this connection of events, by secret currents of might and nlind, and my ingenuity and wilfulness have not thwarted, haye not aided to an appreciable degree.

You cannot with '''O~lr best deliberation and heed come so close to any question as ;\u00b7o\"Jr spontaneous glance shall bring you, whilst you rise from your bed, or walk abroad in the morning after meditating the matter before sleep on the previous night. Our thinking is a pious reception. Our truth of thought is therefore vitiated as much by too violent direction given by our will, as by too great negligence. \\V' e do not determine what we will think.

They catch us up for moments into their heaven and so fully engage us that we take no thought for the ll10rrow, gaze like children, without an effort to mclke them our own.

Do you think the porter and the cook have no anecdotes, no experiences, no wonders for you? Everybody knows as much as the savant. The walls of rude minds arc scrawled all over with facts, with thoughts. They shall one day bring a lantern and read the inscriptions. Every man, in the de- gree in which he has wit and culture, finds his curiosity inflamed concerning the modes of living and thinking of other men, and especially of those classes whose minds have not been subdued by the drill of school education.

To think. I would put myself in the attitude to look in the eye an abstract truth, and I cannot. I blench and withdraw on this side and on that. I seem to know what he meant who said, No man can see God face to tace and live. For example, a man explores the basis of civil government.

A certain wandering light appears) and is the distinction, the principle, we wanted. But the oracle comes because we had preYiously laid siege to the shrine. It seems as if the law of the intellect resembled that law of nature by which we now inspire, now expire the breath; by which the heart now draws in, then hurls out the blood-the law of un .. dulation. So now you must labor with your brains, and now you must forbear your activity and see what the great Soul showeth. The immortality of man is as legitimately preached from the int.ellections as from the moral volitions. Every intellection is mainly prospective. Its present value is its least. Inspect what delights you in Plutarch, in Shakspeare, in Cervantes. Each truth that a writer acquires is a lantern which he turns full on what facts and thoughts lay already in his mind, and behold, all the mats and rubbish which had littered his garret become precious. Every trivial fact in his private biography becomes an illustra- tion of this new principle, revisits the day, and delights all men by its piquancy and new charm. 11en say, \\Vhere did he get this? and think there was something divine in his life.

It is long ere we discover how rich we are. Our history, we are sure, is quite tame: we have nothing to write;- nothing to infer .. But our wiser years still run back to the despised recollections of childhood, and always we are fishing up some wonderful article out of that pond; until by and by we begin to suspect that the biography of the one foolish person we know is, in reality, nothing less than the miniature paraphrase of the hundred volumes of the Universal History .. In the intellect constructive, which we popularly designate by the \\\\Tord Genius, we observe the same balance of two elements as in intellect receptive. The constructive intellect produces thoughts, sentences, poems, plans, designs, systems. It is the gen- eration of the mind, the marriage of thought with nature. To genius must always go two gifts, the thought and the publication. 'The first is revelation, always a miracle, which no frequency of occurrence or incessant study can ever familiarize, but which must always leave the inquirer stupid with wonder. It is the advent of truth into the worle, a form of thought now for the first time bursting into the universe, a child of the old eternal soul, a piece of genuine and immeasurable greatness. It seems, for the time: to inherit all that has yet existed and to dictate to the unborn. It affects every thought of man and goes to fashion every institution. But to make it available it needs a vehicle or a.rt by which it is conveyed to men. To be communicable it must become picture or sensible object. We must learn the", "and to dictate to the unborn. It affects every thought of man and goes to fashion every institution. But to make it available it needs a vehicle or a.rt by which it is conveyed to men. To be communicable it must become picture or sensible object. We must learn the language of facts. The most wonderful inspirations die with their subject if he has no hand to paint them to the senses. The ray of light INTELLECT passes invisible through space and only when it falls on an object is it seen. 'Yben the spiritual energy'\" is directed on something outward, then it is a thought. The relation between it and you first nlakes you, the value of you, apparent to me. The rich inv'entive genius of the painter must be smothered and lost for want of the power of drawing, and in our happy hours we should be inexhaustible poets if once we could break through the silence into adequate rhyme ... ~s all men have some access to primary truth, so all have some art or power of communication in their head, but only in the artist does it descend into the hand. There is an inequality, whose laws we do not yet know, between two men and between two moments of the same man, in respect to this facultv. In common hours we have the same facts as in the ., uncommon or inspired, but they do not sit for their portrait; they are not detached, but lie in a web.

It is a conversion of all nature into the rhetoric of thought, under the eye of judgment, with a strenuous exercise of choice .... ~d yet the imaginative vocabulary seems to be spontaneous also. It does not flow from experience only or ma4liy, but from a richer source. Not by any conscious imitation of particular forms are the grand strokes of the painter executed, but by repairing to the fountain-head of all forms in his mind. \\Ybo is the first drawing-master? ,,~lithout instruction we know very ,veIl the ideal of the human form . ... f\\ child knows if an arm or a leg be distorted in a picture; if the attitude be natural or grand or mean~ though he has never received any instruction in drawing or heard any conversation on the subject, nor can him- self draw with correctness a single feature ..

We entertain ourselves with wonderful forms of men, of women, of animals, of gardens, of woods and of monsters, and the mystic pencil wherewith we then draw has no a'\\vkwardness or inexperience, no meagre ness or poverty; it can design well and group well; its composition is full of art, its colors are well laid on and the \\vhole canvas which it paints is lIfelike and apt to touch us with terror, with tenderness, \\\\tith desire and with grief. Neither are the artist's copies from experience ever mere copies, but always touched and softened by tints from this ideal domain. The conditions essential to a constructive mind do not appear to be so often combined but that a good sentence or verse remains fresh and memorable for a long time. \\\"'et when we write with ease and come out into the free air of thought, we seem to be assured that nothing is easier than to continue this cOlnlnunica ... tion at pleasure. Up, down, around, the kingdom of thought has no inclosures, but the l\\1use ma..~es us free of her city. \",. ell, the world has a million writers. One would think then that good thought would be as familiar as air and water, and the gifts of each new hour would exclude the last. Yet we can count all our good books; nay, I remember any beautiful verse for twenty years.

It is true that the discerning intellect of, the world is always much in advance of the creative, so that there ale nlany competent judges of the best book, and few writers of the best books. But some of the conditions of intellectual construction are of rare occurrence. The intellect is a whole and demands integrity in every work. This is resisted equally by a man's devotion to a single thought and by his ambition to combine too many. Truth is our element of life, yet if a man fasten his attention on a single aspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long time, the truth becomes distorted and not itself but falsehood; herein resembling the air, which is our natural ele- ment and the breath of our nostrils, but if a stream of the same be directed on the body for a time, it causes cold, fever, and even death. How wearisome the grammarian, the phrenologist, the political or religious fanatic, or indeed any possessed mortal whose balance is lost by the exaggeration of a single topic. It 300 INTELLECT is incipient insanity. Every thought is a prison also. I cannot see what you see, because I am caught up by a strong wind and blown so far in one direction that I am out of the hoop of your horizon. Is it any better if the student, to avoid this offence and to liberalize himself, aims to make a mechanical whole of history, or science, or philosophy, by a numerical addition of all the facts that fall within his vision? The world refuses to be analyzed by addition and subtraction. \"\"nen we are young we spend much time and pains in filling our note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics, Art,", "or science, or philosophy, by a numerical addition of all the facts that fall within his vision? The world refuses to be analyzed by addition and subtraction. \"\"nen we are young we spend much time and pains in filling our note-books with all definitions of Religion, Love, Poetry, Politics, Art, in the hope that in the course of a few years we shall have condensed into our encyclo- predia the net value of all the theories at which the world has yet arrived. But year after year our tables get no completeness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola, whose arcs will never meet. Neither by detachment, neither by aggregation is the integrity of the intellect transmitted to its works, but by a vigilance which brings the intellect in its greatness and best state to operate every moment. It must have the same wholeness which nature .. has. Although no diligence can rebuild the universe in a model by the best accumulation or disposition of details, yet does the world reappear in miniature in every event, so that all the laws of nature may be read in the smallest fact. The intellect must have the like perfection in its apprehension and in its works. For this reason, an index or mercury of intellectual proficiency is the perception of identity. ,\\Ve talk with accomplished persons who appear to be strangers in nature .. The cloud, the tree, the turf, the bird, are not theirs, have nothing of them; the world is only their lodging and table. But the poet, whose verses are to be spheral and complete, is one whom Nature cannot deceive, whatsoever face of strangeness she may put on. He feels a strict consanguinity, and detects more likeness than variety in all her changes. \\V'", "them; the world is only their lodging and table.

For the truth was in U~ ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 301 before it was reflected to us from natural objects; and the pro- found genius will cast the likeness of all creatures into every prod- uct of his wit. But if the constructive powers are rare and it is given to few men to be poets, yet every man is a receiver of this descending !1oly ghost, and may well study the laws of its infllL\\:. Exactly parallel is the whole rule of intellectual duty to the rule of moral duty. A self-denial no less austere than the saint's is demanded of the scholar. He must worship truth, and forego all things for that, and ch00se defeat and pain, so that his treasure in thought is thereby augl:lrnted. God offers to e\\Tery mind its choice between truth and repose. Take which you p1ea.s~you can never have both. Between these, as a pendulum, man oscillates. He in whom the love of repose predominates will ac:e~t the first creed, the first philosophy, the first political party he meets-most likely his father's.

He will abstain from dog- matism, and recognize all the opposite negations between which, as walls, his being is swung. He submits to the inconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion, but he is a candidate for truth, as the other is not, and respects the highest law of his being. The circle of the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find the man who can yield him truth. He shall then know that there is somewhat more blessed and great in hearing than in speaking. Happy is the hearing man; unhappy the speaking man. As long as I hear truth I am bathed by a beautiful element and am not conscious of any limits to my nature.

This appears in works both of the useful and fine arts, if we employ the popular distinction of works according to their aim either at use or beauty. Thus in our fine arts, not imitation but creation is the aim. In landscapes the painter should give the suggestion of a fairer creation than we know. Th~ details, the prose of nature he should omit and give us only the spirit and splendor. He should know that the landscape has beauty for his eye because it expresses a thought which is to him good; and this because the same power which sees through his eyes is seen in that spectacle; and he will come to value the expression of nature and not nature itself, and so exalt in his copy the features that please him.

ART ,,\"'hat is that abridgment and selection we observe in all spi1\"- itual actiyity, but itself the creative impulse? for it is the inlet of that higher illumination which teaches to convey a larger sense by simpler symbols. \"Vhat is a man but nature's finer suc- cess in self-explication? \"That is a man but a finer and com- pacter landscape than the horizon figures-nature's eclecticism? and what is his speech, his love of painting, love of nature, but a still finer success-all the weary miles and tons of space and bulk left out and the spirit or moral of it contracted into a musical word. or the most cunning stroke of the pencil? But the artist must employ the symbols in use in his day and nation to conyey his enlarged sense to his fellow-men. Thus the new in art is always formed out of the old. The Genius of the Hour sets his ineffaceable seal on the work and gives it an in- e-:pressible charm for the imagination.

This circumstance gives a value to the Egyptian hieroglyphics, to the Indian, Chinese and l\\1exican idols. however gross and shapeless. They denote the height of the human soul in that hour, and were not fantastic, but sprung f-om a necessity as deep as the world.

The virtue of art lies in detachment, in sequestering one object from the embarrassing variety. l..;ntil one thing comes out from the connection of things, there can be enjoyment, con- templation, but no thought. Our happiness and unhappiness are unproductive. The infant lies in a pleasing trance, but his indi- vidual character and his practical power depend on his daily progress in the separation of things, and dealing V\\.~itb one at a time. Love and all the passions concentrate all existence around a single form. It is the habit of certain minds to give an all- excluding fulness to the object, the thought, the word they alight upon, and to make that for the time the deputy of the world. These are the artists, the orators, the leaders of society. The power to detach and to magnify by detaching is the essence of rhetoric in the hands of the orator and the poet.

The power depends on the depth of the artist's insight of that object he contemplates. For every object has its roots in central nature, and may of course be so exhibited to us as to represent the world. Therefore each work of genius is the tyrant of the hour and concentrates attention on itself. For the time, it is the only thing worth naming to de that-be it a sonnet, an opera, a landscape, a statue, an oration, the plan of a temple, of a campaign, or of a voyage of discovery. Presently we pass to some other object, which rounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example a well-laid garden; and noth .. ing seems worth doing but the laying out of gardens.

A dog, drawn by a master, or a litter of pigs, satisfies and is a reality not less than the frescoes of Angelo. From this succession of excellent objects we learn at last the immensity of the world, the opulence of human nature, which can run out to infinitude in any direction. But I also learn that what astonished and fascinated me in the first work, astonished me in the second work also; that excellence of all things is one. The office of painting and sculpture seems to be merely initial. The best pictures can easily tell us their last secret. The best pictures are rude draughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines and dyes which make up the ever-changing \"landscape with figures~' amidst which we dwell. Painting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs. \"'Vhen that has educated the frame to self-possession, to nimbleness, to grace, the steps of the dancing- master are better forgotten; so painting teaches me the splendor of color and the expression of form, and as I see many pictures and higher genius in the art, I see the boundless opulence of the pencil: the indifierency in which the artist stands free to choose out of the possible forms. If he can draw every thing, why draw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the eternal picture which nature paints in the street, with moving men and children, beg- gars and fine ladies!, draped in red and green and blue and gray; long-haired, grizzled, white-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf: expanded, elfish--capped and based by heaven, earth and sea . .. ~ gallery' of SCUlpture teaches more austerely the same lesson .", "the street, with moving men and children, beg- gars and fine ladies!, draped in red and green and blue and gray; long-haired, grizzled, white-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf: expanded, elfish--capped and based by heaven, earth and sea . .. ~ gallery' of SCUlpture teaches more austerely the same lesson . ... .\\s picture teaches the coloring, so SCUlpture the anatomy of form. ,\\\\l1en I have seen fine statues and afterwards enter a public assembly, I understand well what he meant who said, ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES 30 9 \"When I have been reading Homer, all men look like giants.\" I too see that painting and sculpture are gymnastics of the eye, its training to the niceties and curiosities of its function. There is no statue like this living man, with his infinite advantage over all ideal sculpture, of perpetual variety. '\\Vhat a gallery of art have I here! No mannerist made these varied groups and diverse orig- inal single figures. Here is the artist himself improvising, grim and glad, at his block. Now one thought strikes him, nowan- other, and with each moment he alters the whole air, attitude and expression of his clay. Away with your nonsense of oil and easels, of marble and chisels; except to open your eyes to the masteries of eternal art, they are hypocritical rubbish. The reference of all production at last to an aboriginal Power explains the traits common to all works of the highest art-that they are universally intelligible; that they restore to us the simplest states of mind, and are religious. Since what skill is therein shown is the reappearance of the original soul, a jet of pure light, it should produce a similar impression to that made by natural objects.

Since what skill is therein shown is the reappearance of the original soul, a jet of pure light, it should produce a similar impression to that made by natural objects. In happy hours, nature appears to us one with art; art perfected-the work of genius. And the individual in whom simple tastes and susceptibility to all the great human influences overpower the accidents of a local and special culture, is the best critic of art. Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we find it not. The best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces, in outlines, or rules of art can ever teach, namely a radiation from the work of art, of human character-a wonderful expression througb stone, or canvas, or musical sound, of the deepest and simplest attributes of our nature, and therefore most intelligible at last to those souls which have these attributes. In the sculptures of the Greeks, in the masonry of the Romans, and in the pictures of the Tuscan and Venetian masters, the highest charm is the universal language they speak. A confession of moral nature, of purity, love, and hope, breathes from them all. That which we carry to them, the same we bring back more fairly illustrated in the memory.

He studies the technical rules on these wonderful remains, but forgets that these works were not always thus constellated; that they are the contributions of many ages and many countries; that each came out of the solitary workshop of one artist, who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the existence of other sculpture, created his work without other model saye life, household life, and the sweet and smart of personal relations, of beating hearts, and meeting eyes; of poverty and necessity and hope and fear. These were his inspirations, and these are the effects he carries borne to your 'Jeart and mind. In proportion to his force, the artist will find in his work an outlet for his proper character. He must not be in a.ny manner pinched or hindered by his material, but through his necessity of imparting himself the adamant will be wax in his bands, and will allow an adequate communication of himself, in his full stature and proportion. He need not cumber himself with a conventional nature and culture, nor ask what is the mode in Rome or in Paris, but that h0use and weather and manner of living which poverty and the fate of birth have made at once so odious and so dear, in the gray unpainted wood cabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in the log-hut of the back- wO'1ds, or in the narrow lodging where he has endured the cnn .. straints and seeming of a city poverty, will serve as well as any other condition as", "in the gray unpainted wood cabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in the log-hut of the back- wO'1ds, or in the narrow lodging where he has endured the cnn .. straints and seeming of a city poverty, will serve as well as any other condition as the symbol of a thought which pours itself indifferently through all. I remember when in my younger days I had heard of the wonders of Italian painting, I fancied the great pictures would be great strangers; some surprising combination of color and form; a foreign wonder, barbaric pearl and gold, like the spontoons and standards of the militia, which play such pranks in the eyes and imaginations of school-boys. I was to see and acquire I knew not what. \"nen I came at last to Rome and saw with eyes the pictures, I found that genius left to novices the gay and *\"antastjc and ostentatious, and itself pierced direct.ly to the ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES simple and true; that it was familiar and sincere; that it Wal the old, eternal fact I had met already in so many forms-unto which I lived; that it was the plain 'YOU and 1ne I knew so wp.l]- had left at home in so many conversations.

I now require this of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not that they dazzle me. Pictures must not be too pictur~sque. Nothing astonishes men so much as common- sense and plain dealing. All great actions have been simple, and all great pictures are. The Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent example of this peculiar merit. A calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture, and goes directly to the heart. It seems almost to calI. you by name. The sv .... eet and sublime face of Jesus is beyond praise, yet ho,v it disappoints all florid expectations! This fa- miliar, silnple, home-speaking countenance is as if one should meet a friend. The knowledge of picture dealers has its value, but listen not to their criticism when your heart is touched by genius. It was not painted for them, it was painted for you; for such as had eyes capable of being touched by simplicity and lofty emotions.

The real value of the Iliad or the Transfiguration ART is as signs of power; billows or ripples they are of the stream of tendencY'\u00b7 tokens of the everlasting effort to produce, which even ... , in its ,,\"orst estate the soul betrays. Art has not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast with the most potent influences of the world, if it is not practical and moral, if it do not stand in connection with the conscience, if it do not make the poor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice of lofty cheer. There is higher work for Art than the arts. They are abortive births of an imperfect or vitiated in- stinct. .Art is the need to create; but in its essence, immense and universal, it is impatient of working with lame or tied hands, and of making cripples and monsters, such as all pictures and statues are. Nothing less than the creation of man and nature is its end . . A. man should find in it an outlet for his whole energy. He may paint and carve only as long as he can do that.

Art should ex- hilarate, and throw doV\\~ the walls of circumstance on every side, awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal relation and power which the work evinced in the artist, and its highest effect is to make new artists. }\\.lready History is old enough to witness the old age and disap- pearance of particular arts. The art of sculpture is long ago per- ished to any real effect. It was originally a useful art, a mode of writing~ a sayage:'s record of gratitude or devotion, and among a people possessed of a wonderful perception of form this childish carving was refined to the utmost splendor of effect. But it is the game of a rude and youthful people, and not the manly labor of a wise and spiritual nation. Under an oak .. tree loaded with leaves and DUts, under a sky full of eternal eyes, I stand in a thorough- fare; but in the works of our plastic arts and especially of sculp ... ture, creation is driven into a corner. I cannot hide from myself that there is a certain appearance of paltriness, as of toys and the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture. Nature transcends all our moods of thought, and its secret we do not yet find. But the gal- lery stands at the mercy of our moods, and there is a moment when it becomes frivolous.

ESSAYS: FIRST SERIES mire in \"stone dolls.\" Sculpture may serve to teach 1 he pupil how deep is the secret of form, how purely the spirit can translate its meanings into that eloquent dialect. But the statue will look cold and false before that new activity which needs to roll through all things, and is impatient of counterfeits and things not alive. Picture and sculpture are the celebrations and festivities of form. But true art is never fixed, but always flowing. The sweetest music is not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it speaks from its instant life tones of tenderness, truth, or courage. The oratorio has already lost its relation to the morn- ing, to the SUD, and the earth, but that persuading voice is in tune with these. All works of art should not be detached, but e..\"Ij{\" tempore performances. A great man is a new statue in every atti .. tude and action. A beautiful woman is a picture which drives aU beholders nobly maL. Life may be lyric or epic, as well as a poem or a romance. A true announcement of the law of creation, if a man were found worthy to declare it, would carry art up into the kingdom of nature, and destroy its separate and contrasted existence. The fountains of invention and beauty in modern society are all but dried up. A popular novel, a theatre, or a ball-room makes us feel that we are all paupers in the almshouse of this world, with .. out dignity, without skill or industry. Art is as poor and", "existence.

The old tragic Necessity, which lowers on the brows even of the Venuses and the Cupids of the antique, and furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of such anomalous figures into nature- namely that they were inevitable; that the artist was drunk with a passion for form which he could not resist, and which vented itself in these fine extravagances-no longer dignines the chisel or the pencil. But the artist and the connoisseur now seek in art the exhibition of their talent, or an asylum from the evils of life. Men are not well pleased with the figure they make in their own imaginations, and they flee to art, and convey their better sense in an oratorio, a statue, or a picture. Art makes the same effort which a sensual prosperity makes; namely to detach the beautiful . from the useful, to do up the work as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on tc enjoyment. These solaces and compensation~! tb,s ART division of beauty from use, the laws of nature do not permit.

The art that thus separates is itself first separated. Art must not be a superficial talent, but must begin farther back in Inan. 'Kow men do not see nature to be beautiful, and they go to make 1 statue which shall be. They abhor men as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible, and console themselves with color-bags and blocks of marble. They reject life as prosaic, and create a death which they call poetic. They despatch the day's weary chores, and fly to voluptuous reveries. They eat and drink, that they may after .... wards execute the ideaL Thus is art vilified; the name conveys to the mind its secondary and bad senses; it stands in the imagi ... nation as somewhat contrary to nature, and struck with death fronl the first. \\\\T euld it not be better to begin higher up-to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to serve the ideal in eating and drinking, in drawing the breath, and in the functions of !iff? Beauty must come back to the useful arts, and the distinction betw'een the fine and the useful arts be forgotten. If history were truly told, if life were nobly spent, it would be no longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from the other. In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful.

Theologians think it a pretty air-castle to talk of the spiritual meaning of a ship or a cloud, of a city or a contract, but they prefer to come again to the solid ground of historical evidence; and even the poets are con ten ted with a civil and conformed manner of living, and to write poems from the fancy, at a safe distance from their own experience. But the hiahest minds of the world have never ceased to explore the o double meaning, or shall I say the quadruple or the centuple or much more manifold meaning, of every sensuous fact; Orpheus, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Plato, Plutarch, Dante, Swedenborg, and the masters of sculpture, picture and poetry.

And this hidden truth, that the fountains whence all this river of Time and its creatures fioweth are intrinsically ideal and beautiful, draws us to the consideration of the nature and func- tions of the Poet, or the man of Beauty; to the means and ma- terials he uses, and to the general aspect of the art in the present time. The breadth of the problem is great, for the poet is repre~ sentative. He stands among partial men for the complete man, and apprises us not of his wealth, but of the common wealth. \"The young man reveres men of genius, because, to speak truly, lthey are more himself than he is.

There is no man who does not anticipate a supersensual utility in the sun and stars, earth and water. These stand and wait to render him a peculiar service. But there is some obstruction or some excess of phlegm in our constitution, which does not suffer them to yield the due effect. Too feeble fall the impressions of nature on us to make us artists.

Each is that which he is, essentially, so that be cannot be surmounted or analyzed, and each of these three has the power of the others latent in him and his own, patent. The poet is the sayer, the namer, and represents beauty. He is a sovereign, and stands on the centre. For the world is not painted or adorned, but is from the beginning beautiful; and God han not made some beautiful things, but Beauty is the creator of the universe. Therefore the poet is not any permissive potentate, but is emperor in his own right. Criticism is infested with a cant of materialism, which assumes that manual skill and activity is the first merit of all men, and disparages such as say and do not, overlooking the fact that some men, namely poets, are natural 322 THE POET sayers, sent into the world to the end of expression, and con ... founds them with those whose province is action but who quit it to imitate the sayers.

For poetry was all written before time was, and whenever we are so finely organized that Vle can penetrate into that region where the air is music, we hear those primal warblings and at- tempt to write them down, but we lose ever and anon a word or a verse and substitute something of our own, and thus miswrite the poem. The men of more delicate ear write down these ,=adences more faithfully, and these transcripts, though imperfect, become the songs of the nations. For nature is as truly beautiful as it is good, or as it is reasonable, and must as much appear as it must be done, or be known. Words and deeds aTf' quite indifferent modes of the divine energy. Words are also a ctions, and actions are a kind of words. The sign and credentials of the poet are that he announces that which no Ulan foretold. He is the true and only doctor; he knows and tells; be is the only teller of news, for he was present and privy to the appearance which he describes.

For the experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world seems always waiting for its poet. I remember when I was young how much I was moved one morning by tidings that genius had ap- peared in a youth who sat near me at table. He had left his work and gone rambling none knew whither, and had written hundred!: of lines, but could not tell whether that which was in him was therein told; he could tell nothing but that all was changed- man, beast, heaven, earth and sea. How gladly we listened! how credulous! Society seemed to be compromised. \\\\7e sat in the aurora of a sunrise which was to put out aU the stars. Boston seemed to be at twice the distance it had the night before, or was much farther than that. Rome-what was Rome? Plutarch and Shakspeare were in the yellow leaf, and Homer no more should be heard of. It is much to know that poetry has been written this very day, under this very roof, by your side. \"~hat! that wonderful spirit has not expired!

Of course the value of genius to us is in the veracity of its report. Talent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds. Mankind in good earnest have availed so far in understanding themselves and their work, that the fore- most watchman on the peak announces his news.

But, leaving these victims of vanity, let us, with new hope, ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES observe how nature, by worthier impulses, has insured the poet's fidelity to his office of announcement and affirming, namely by the beauty of things, which becomes a new and higher beauty when expressed. Nature offers all her creatures to him as a pic. ... ture-Ianguage. Being used as a type, a second wonderful value appears in the object, far better than its old value; as the car- penter's stretched cord, if you hold your ear close enough, is musical in the breeze. \"Things more excellent than every image,') says J amblichus, \"are expressed through images.\" Things admit of being used as symbols because nature is a symbol, in the whole, and in every part. Every line we can draw in the sand has ex- pression; and there is no body without its spirit or genius. All form is an effect of character; all condition, of the quality of the life; all harmony, of health; and for this reason a perception of beauty should be sympathetic, or proper only to the good. The beautiful rests on the foundations of the necessary. The soul makes the body, as the wise Spenser teaches:- \"So every spirit, as it is more pure, . And hath in it the more of heavenly light, So it the fairer body doth procure To habit in, and it more fairly dight, With cheerful grace and amiable sight. For, of the soul, the body fonn doth take, For soul is form, and doth the body make.\" .

We ; stand before the secret of the world, there wbere Being passes, into Appearance and Unity into Variety_ I Ahe Universe is the externization of the soul. Wherever the life is, that bursts into appearance around it. Our science is sensual, and therefore superficial.

I find that the fascination resides in the symbol. Who loves nature? Who does not? Is it only poets, and men of leisure and cultivation, who live with her? No; but also hunters, fanners, grooms and butchers, though they ex- press their affection in their choice of life and not in their choice of words. The writer wonders what the coachman or the hunter \"Jalues in riding, in horses and dogs. It is not superficial qualities. \\\\'ben you talk with him he holds these at as slight a rate as you His worship is sympathetic; he has no definitions, but he is com- manded in nature by the living power which he feels to be there present. No imitation or playing of these things would content him; he loves the earnest of the north wind, of rain, of stone and wood and iron. A beauty not explicable is dearer than a beauty which we can see to the end of. It is nature the symbol, nature certifying the supernatural, body overflowed by life which he worships with coarse but sincere rites .. The inwardness and mystery of this attachment drive men of every class to the use of emblems. The schools of poets and philos- ophers are not more intoxicated with their symbols than the populace with theirs. In our political parties, compute the power of badges and emblems.

The people fancy they hate poetry, and they are all poets and mystics! Beyond this universality of the symbolic language, we are apprised of the divineness of this superior use of things, whereby the world is a temple whose walls are covered with emblems, pic- tures and commandments of the Deity-in this, that there is no fact in nature which does not carry the whole sense of nature; and the distinctions which we make in events and in affairs, oi low and high, honest and base, disappear when nature is used as a symbol. Thought makes everything fit for use. The vocabulary of an omniscient man would embrace words and images excluded from polite conversation. vVhat would be base, or even obscene, to the obscene, becomes illustrious, spoken in a new connection of thought.

Small and mean things serve as well as great symbols. The meaner the type by which a law is ex- pressed, the more pungent it is, and the more lasting in the memories of men; just as we choose the smallest box or case in which any needful utensil can be carried. Bare lists of words are found suggestive to an imaginative and excited mind; as it is related of Lord Chatham that he was accustomed to read in Bailey's Dictionary when he was preparing to speak in Parlia- ment. The poorest experience is rich enough for all the purposes of expressing thought. Why covet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions) serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles. We are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use. We can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity. It does not need that a poem should be long. Every word waS! once a poem. Every new relation is a new word. Also we use de- fects and deformities to a sacred purpose, so expressing our sense that the evils of the world are such only to the evil eye.

For as it is dislocation and detachment from the life of God that makes things ugly, the poet, who re-attaches things to nature and the \\\\nole-re-attaching even artificial things and violation of nature, to nature, by a deeper insight-disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts .. Readers of poetry see the factory- village and the railway, and fancy that the poetry of the land- scape is broken up by these; for these works of art are not yet consecrated in their reading; but the poet sees them fall within the great Order not less than the beehive or the spider's geo- metrical web. Kature adopts them very fast into her vital circles, and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own. Besides, in a centred mind, it signifies nothing how many mechanical inven- tions you exhibit. Though you add millions, and never so surpris- in~~ the fact of mechanics has not gained a grain's weight. The spiritual fact remains unalterable, by many or by few particu- lars; as no mountain is of any appreciable height to break the curve of the sphere. A shrewd country-boy goes to the city for the first time, and the complacent citizen is not satisfied with his little wonder.

The world being thus put under the mind for verb and noun, the poet. is he who can articulate it.

For through that better per- ception he stands one step nearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis; perceives that thought is multiform; th:1.t within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form; and following with his eyes the life, uses the forms which express that life, and so his speech", "nearer to things, and sees the flowing or metamorphosis; perceives that thought is multiform; th:1.t within the form of every creature is a force impelling it to ascend into a higher form; and following with his eyes the life, uses the forms which express that life, and so his speech flows with the flowing of nature. All the facts of the anitnal economy, sex, nutri- ment, gestation, birth, growth, are symbols of the passage of the world into thp soul of man, to suffer there a change and re- appear a new and higher fact. He uses forms according to the life, and not according to the form. This is true science. The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation and animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs them as signs .. He knows why the plain or meadow of space was strawn with these flowers we call suns and moons and stars; why the great deep is adorned with animals, with men, and gods; for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the horses of thought. By virtue of this science the poet is the Namer or Language- maker, naming things sometimes after their appearance, some- times after their essence, and giving to everyone its own name and not another'S, thereby rejoicing the intellect, which delights in detachments or boundary. The poets made all the words, and therefore language is the archives of history, and, if we must say it, a sort of tomb of the muses. For though the origin of most of our words is forgotten, each word was at first a stroke of genius, and obtained currency because for the moment it sym\u00b7 bolized the war ld to the first speaker and to the hearer.

The etymologist finds the deadest word to have been once a brilliant picture. Language is fossil poetry. As the limestone of the con\u00b7 tinent consists of infinite masses of the shells of animalcules, so language is made up of images or tropes, which now, in their secondary use, have long ceased to remind us of their poetic origin. But the poet names the thing because he sees it, or come3 .330 THE POET one step nearer to it than any other. This expression or naming is not art, but a second nature, grown out of the first, as a leaf out of a tree. \"nat we call nature is a certain self-regulated mo- tion or change; and nature does all things by her own hands, and does not leave another to baptize her but baptizes herself; and this through the metamorphosis again. I remember that a certain poet described it to me thus:- Genius is the activity which repairs the decays of things, whether wholly or partly of a material and finite kind. Nature, through all her kingdoms, insures herself. Nobody cares for planting the poor fungus; so she shakes down from the gills of one agaric countless spores, anyone of which, being preserved, trans- mits new billions of spores to-morrow or next day_ The new agaric of this hour has a chance which the old one had not.

She makes a", "mits new billions of spores to-morrow or next day_ The new agaric of this hour has a chance which the old one had not. This atom of seed is thrown into a new place, not subject to the acci- dents which destroyed its parent two rods off. She makes a man; and having brought him to ripe age, she will no longer run the risk of losing this wonder at a blow, but she detaches from him a new self. that the kind may be safe from accidents to which the individual is exposed. So when the soul of the poet has come to ripeness of thought, she detaches and sends away from it its poems or songs-a fearless, sleepless, deathless progeny, which is not exposed to the accidents of the weary kingdom of time; a fearless, vivacious offspring, clad with wings (such was the virtue of the soul out of which they came) which carry them fast and far, and infi.\"{ them irrecoverably into the hearts of men. These wings are the beauty of the poet's soul. The songs, thus flying immortal from their mortal parent, are pursued by clamor- ous flights of censures, which swarm in far greater numbers and threaten to devour them; but these last are not winged. At the end of a yery short leap they fall plump down and rot, having received from the souls out of which they came no beautiful wings. But the melodies of the poet ascend and leap and pierce into the deeps of infinite time. So far the bard taught me, using his freer speech. But nature has a higher end, in the production of new individuals, than se- ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 33 1 curity, namely ascension, or the passage of the soul into higher forms.

I knew in my younger days the sculptor who made tile statue of the youth which stands in the public garden. He was, as I remember, unable to tell directly what made him happy or unhappy, but by wonderful indirections he could tell. He rose one day, according to his habit, before the dawn, and saw the morning break, grand as the eternity out of which it came, and for many days after, he strove to express this tranquillity, and 10! his chisel had fashioned out of marble the fonn of a beautiful youth, Phosphorus, whose aspect is such that it is said all per- sons who look on it become silent. The poet also resigns himself to his mood, and that thought which agitated him is expressed, but alter idem, in a manner totally new. The expression is or- ganic, or the new type which things themselves take when lib- erated. As, in the sun, objects paint their images on the retina of the eye, so they, sharing the aspiration of the whole universe, tend to paint a far more delicate copy of their essence in his mind .. Like the metamorphosis of things into higher organic forms is their change into melodies. Over everything stands its dremon or soul, and, as the form of the thing is reflected by the eye, so the soul of the thing is reflected by a melody_ The sea, the mountain- ridge, Niagara, and every flower-bed, pre-exist, or super-exist, in pre-cantations, which sail like odors in", "melodies.

And herein is the legitimation of criticism, in the mind's faith that the poems are a corrupt version of some text in nature with which they ought to be made to tally. A rhyme in one of our sonnets should not be less pleasing than the iterated nodes of a seashell, or the resembling difference of a group of flowers. The pairing of the birds is an idyl, not tedious as our idyls are; a tempest is a rough ode, without falsehood or rant; a summer, with its harvest sown, reaped and stored, is an epic song, sub- ordinating how many admirably executed parts. Why should not the symmetry and truth that modulate these, glide into our spi~ and we participate the invention of nature?

A spy they will not suffer; a lover, a poet, is the transcendency of their own nature-him they will suffer .. The condition of true naming, on the poet's part, is his resigning himself to the divine aura which breathes through forms, and accon1panying that. /It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns, that beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious intellect h!! is capable of a new energy (as of an intellect doubled on itself), by abandonment to the nature of things; that beside his privacy Df power as an individual man, there is a great public power Dn which be can draw, by unlocking, at all risks, his human doors, and suffering the ethereal tides to roll and circulate through him; then he is caught up into the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder, his thought is law, and his words are universally in- telligible as the plan t5 and animals. The poet knows tha t he ~peaks adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or \u00b7'with the flower of the mind\"; not with the intellect used as an Drgan, but with the intellect released ~rom all service and suf- fered to take its direction from its celestial life; or as the an- cients were wont to express themselves, not with intellect alone but with the intellect inebriated by nectar.

As the traveller who has lost his way throws his reins on his horse's neck and trusts to the instinct of the animal to find his road, so must we do with the divine animal who carries us through this world. For if in any manner we can stimulate this instinct, new passages are opened for us into nature; the mind flows into and through things hardest and highest, and the metamorphosis is possible. This is the reason why bards love wine, mead narcotics coffee , , , tea, opium, the fumes of sandalwood and tobacco, or whatever . other procurers of animal exhilaration. All men avail them- selves of such means as they can, to add this extraordinary power to their normal powers; and to this end they prize COD- l. versation, music, pictures, sculpture, dancing, theatres, travel- ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 333 ling, war, n10bs, fires, gaming, politics, or love, or science, or animal intoxication-which are several coarser or finer quasi .. mechanical substitutes for the true nectar, which is the ravish .. ment of the intellect by coming nearer to the fact. These are au.'r{iliaries to the centrifugal tendency of a man, to his passage out into free space, and they help him to escape the custody of that body in which he is pent up, and of that jail-yard of indi ... vidual relations in which he is enclosed.

For poetry is not 'Devil's wine,' but God's wine. It is with this as it is with toys. We fill the hands and nurseries of our children with all manner of dolls, drums and horses; withdrawing their eyes from the plain face and sufficing objects of nature, the sun and moon, the animals, the water and stones, which should be their toys. So the poet's habit of living j should be set on a key so low that the common influences should , delight him.

The ancient British bards had for the title of their order, \"Those who are free throughout the world.\" They are free, and they make free. An imaginative book renders us much more service at first, by stimulating us through its tropes, than afterward when we arrive at the precise sense of the author. I think nothing is of any value in books excepting the transcendental and extraordinary. If a man is in- flamed and carried a\\vay by his thought, to that degree that he forgets the authors and the public and heeds only this one dream ~ which holds him like an insanity, let me read his paper, and you may have all the arguments and histories and criticism. All the value which attaches to Pythagoras, Paracelsus, Cornelius Agrippa, Cardan, Kepler, Swedenborg, Schelling, Oken, or any other who introduces questionable facts into his cosmogony, as angels, devils, magic, astrology, palmistry, mesmerism, and so on, is the certificate we have of departure from routine, and that there is a new witness. That also is the best success in con .. versation, the magic of liberty, which puts the world like a ball in our hands.

That also is the best success in con .. versation, the magic of liberty, which puts the world like a ball in our hands. How cheap even the liberty then seems; how mean to study, when an emotion communicates to the intellect the power to sap and upheave nature; how great the perspective! nations, times, systems, enter and disappear like threads in tapes- try of large figure and Inany colors; dream delivers us to dream, and while the drunkenness lasts we will sell our bed, our philoso- phy, our religion, in our opulence. J'There is good reason why we should prize this liberation. 1:he fate of the poor shepherd, who, blinded and lost in the snow .. storm, perishes in a drift within a few feet of his cottage door 7 is THE POET an emblem of the state of man. On the brink. of the waters of life and truth, we are miserably dying. The inaccessibleness of every thought but that we are in, is wonderful. What if you come near to it; you are as remote when you are nearest as when you are farthest. Every thought is also a prison; every heaven is also a prison. Therefore we love the poet, the inventor, who in any 1 form, whether in an ode or in an action or in look~ and behavi?r, I has yielded us a new thought. He unlocks our chaIns and admIts < us to a new scene. This emancipation is dear to all men, and the power to im- part it, as it must come fronl greater depth and scope of thought, is a measure of intellect.

This emancipation is dear to all men, and the power to im- part it, as it must come fronl greater depth and scope of thought, is a measure of intellect. Therefore all books of the imagination endure, all which ascend to that truth that the writer sees mture beneath him, and uses it as his exponent. Every' verse or sentence possessing this virtue will take care of its own immortality. The religions of the world are the ejacula- tions of a few imaginative men. But the quality of the imagination is to flow, and not to freeze. The poet did not stop at the color or the form, but read their meaning; neither may he rest in this meaning, but he makes the same objects exponents of his new thought. Here is the dif- ference betwi~t the poet and the mystic, that the last nails a sym ... bol to one sense, which was a true sense for a moment, but soon bf;comes old and false. For all symbols are fluxional; all lan- guage is vehicular and transitive, and is good, as ferries and horses are, for conveyance, not as farms and houses are, for homestead. ~Iysticism consists in the mistake of an accidental and indi,.idual symbol for an universal one. The morning-red ... ness happens to be the favorite meteor to the eyes of Jacob Behm:n, and comes to stand to him for truth and faith; and, he belIeves, should stand for the same realities to every reader.

And the mystic must be steadily told- ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 33i All that you say is just as true without the tedious use of that symbol as with it. Let us have a little algebra, instead of this trite rhetoric-universal signs, instead of these village symbols -and we shall both be gainers. The history of hierarchies seems to show that all religious error consisted in making the symbol too stark and solid, and was at last nothing but an e..\"'{cess of the organ of language. Swedenborg, of all men in the recent ages, stands eminently for the translator of nature into thought. I do not know the man in history to whom things stood so uniformly for \\vords. Before him the metamorphosis continually plays. Everything on which his eye rests, obeys the impulses of moral nature. The figs be- come grapes whilst he eats them. When some of his angels affirmed a truth, the laurel twig which they held blossomed in their hands. The noise which at a distance appeared like gnashing and thumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice of disputants. The men in one of his visions, seen in heavenly light, appeared like dragons, and seemed in darkness; but to each other they appeared as men, and when the light from heaven shone into their cabin, they complained", "thumping, on coming nearer was found to be the voice of disputants. The men in one of his visions, seen in heavenly light, appeared like dragons, and seemed in darkness; but to each other they appeared as men, and when the light from heaven shone into their cabin, they complained of the darkness, and were compelled to shut the window that they might see. There was this perception in him which makes the poet or seer an object of awe and terror, namely that the same man or society of men may wear one aspect to themselves and their companions, and a different aspect to higher intelligences. Cer- tain priests, whom he describes as conversing very learnedly to- gether, appeared to the children who were at some distance, like dead horses; and many the like misappearances. And instantly the mind inquires whether these fishes under the bridge, yonder oxen in the pasture, those dogs in the yard, are immutably fishes, oxen and dogs, or only so appear to me, and I,erchance to them .. selves appear upright men; and whether I appear as a man to all eyes. The Brahmins and Pythagoras propounded the same question, and if any poet has witnessed the transformation he doubtless found it in harmony with various experiences. We have all seen changes as considerable in wheat and caterpillars. He is the poet and shall draw us with love and terror, who sees THE POET through the flowing vest the firm nature, and can declare it. I look in vain for the poet whQm I describe.

I look in vain for the poet whQm I describe. We do not with sufficient plainness or sufficient profoundness address ourselves to life. nor dare we chaunt our own times and social circum .. stance: If we filled the day with bravery, we should not shrink from celebrating it. Time and nature yield us many gifts, but not yet the timely man, the new religion, the reconciler, whom all things await. Dante's praise is that he dared to write his autobiography in colossal cipher, or into universality. We have yet had no genius in America, with tyrannous eye, which knew the value of our incomparable materials, and saw, in the bar ... barism and materialism of the times, another carnival of the same gods whose picture he so much admires in Homer; then in the ~fiddle Age; then in Calvinism. Banks and tariffs, the news- paper and caucus, I\\Iethodism and Unitarianism, are flat and dull to dull people, but rest on the same foundations of wonder .as the town of Troy and the temple of Delphi, and are as swiftly \";lassing away. Our log-rolling, our stumps and their politics, our fisheries, our Kegroes and Indians, our boats and our repudia- jons, the wrath of rogues and the pusillanimity of honest men, the northern trade, the southern planting, the western clearing, Oregon and Texas, are yet unsung. Yet America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.

Milton is too literary~ and Homer too literal and historical. But I am not wise enough for a national criticism, and must use the old largeness a little longer, to discharge my errand from the muse to the poet concerning his art.

The painter, the sculptor, the composer, the epic rhapsodist, the orator, all partake one desire, namely to express themselves symmQtrically and abundantly,. not dwarfishly and fragmentarily. They found or put themselves in certain condi ... tions, as, the painter and sculptor before some impressive hUlnan figures; the orator into the assembly of the people; and the others in such scenes as each has found exciting to his intellect; and each presently feels the new desire. He hears a voice, he sees a beckoning. Then he is apprised, with wonder, what herds of dremons hem him in. He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter,\"\"By God it is in me and must go forth of me.\" He pur- sues a beauty, half seen, which flies before him.

He can no more rest; he says, with the old painter,\"\"By God it is in me and must go forth of me.\" He pur- sues a beauty, half seen, which flies before him. The poet pours out verses in every solitude. Most of the things he says are con- ventional, no doubt; but by and by he says something which is original and beautiful. That charms him. He would say noth .. ing else but such things. In our way of talking we say 'That is yours, this is mine;' but the poet knows well that it is not his; that it is as strange and beautiful to him as to you; he would fain hear the like eloquence at length. Once having tasted this imnlortal ichor, he cannot have enough of it, and as an admirable creative power exists in these intellections, it is of the last im .. portance that these things get spoken. What a little of all we know is said! What drops of all the sea of our science are baled up! and by what accident it is that these are exposed, when so many secrets sleep in nature! Hence the necessity of speech and song; hence these throbs and heart-beatings in the orator, at the door of the assembly, to the end namely that thought may be ejaculated as Logos, or Word. Doubt not, 0 poet, but persist. Say 'It is in me, and shall out.'

Theo- retic kidnappers and slaye-drivers, they esteem each man the victim of another, who winds him round his finger by knowing the law of his being; and, by such cheap signboards as the color of his beard or the slope of his occiput, reads the inventory of his fortunes and character. The grossest ignorance does not dis- gust like this impUdent knowingness. The physicians say they are not materialists; but they are-Spirit is matter reduced to an extreme thinness: 0 so thin 1 But the definition of spiritual should be, that which is its own evidence. What notions do they ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 347 attach to love! what to religion! One would not willingly pro- nounce these words in their hearing, and give them the occasion to profane them. I saw a gracious gentleman who adapts his conversation to the form of the head of the man he talks with! I had fancied that the value of life lay in its inscrutable possi- bilities; in the fact that I never know, in addressing myself to a new individual, what may befall me.

I carry the keys of my castle in my hand, ready to throw them at the feet of my lord, \u00b7 whenever and in what disguise soever he shall appear. I know he is in the neighborhood, hidden among vagabonds. Shall I preclude my future by taking a high seat and kindly adapting my conversation to the shape of heads? When I come to that, the doctors shall buy me for a cent. 'But, sir, medical history; the report to the Institute; the proven facts!' I distrust the facts and the inferences. Temperament is the veto or limitation- power in the constitution, very justly applied to restrain an opposite excess in the constitution, but absurdly offered as a bar to original equity. When virtue is in presence, all subordinate powers sleep. On its own level, or in view of nature, temperament is final. I see not, if one be once caught in this trap of so-called sciences, any escape for the man from the links of the chain of physical necessity. Given such an embryo, such a history must follow. On this platform one lives in a sty of sensualism, and would soon come to suicide. But it is impossible that the creative power should exclude itself. Into every intelligence there is a door which is never closed, through which the creator passes. The intellect, seeker of absolute truth, or the heart, lover of absolute good, intervenes for our succor, and at one v/hisper of these high powers we awake from ineffectual struggles with this nightmare.

We hurl it into its own hell, and cannot again contract ourselves to so base a state. The secret of the illusoriness is in the necessity of a succession of moods or objects. Gladly we would anchor, but the anchorage is quicksand. This onward trick of nature is too strong for us: Pero si muove. When at night I look at the moon and stars, I seem stationary, and they to hurry_ Our love of the real draws EXPERIENCE us to permanence, but health of body consists in circulation, and sanity of mind in variety or facility of association.

Once I took such delight in Montaigne that I thought I should not need any other book; before that, in Shak- speare; then in Plutarch; then in Plotinus; at one time in I Bacon; afterwards in Goethe; even in Bettine; but now I turn the pages of either of them languidly, whilst I still cherish their genius. So 'with pictures; each will bear an emphasis of atten- tion once, which it cannot retain, though we fain would continue to be pleased in that manner.

I have had good lessons from pictures which I have since seen without emotion or re- mark. _1\\ deduction must be made from the opinion which even the wise express on a new book or occurrence. Their opinion gives me tidings of their mood, and some vague guess at the new fact, but is nowise to be trusted as the lasting relation between that intellect and that thing. The child asks, 'Mamma, why don't I like the story as well as when you told it me yesterday?' Alas! child, it is even so with the oldest cherubim of knowledge. But will it answer thy question to say, Because thou wert born to a whole and this story is a particular? The reason of the pain this discovery causes us (and we make it late in respect to works nf art and intellect) is the plaint of tragedy which murmurs from it in regard to persons, to friendship and love. That immobility and absence of elasticity which we find in the arts, we find with more pain in the artist. There is no power of expansion in men. Our friends early appear to us as repre- sentatives of certain ideas which they never pass or exceed. They stand on the bri~ of the ocean of thought and power, but they never take the smgle step that would bring them there.

I cannot recall any form of man who is not superfluous sometimes. But is not this pitiful? Life is not worth the taking, to do tricks in. Of course it needs the whole society to give the symmetry we seek. The parti-colored wheel must revolve very fast to appear I white. Something is earned too by conversing with so much folly and defect. In fine, whoever loses, we are always of the gain- ing party. Divinity is behind our failures and follies also. The plays of children are nonsense, but very educative nonsense. So it is with the largest and solemnest things, with commerce, gov ... ernment, church, marriage, and so with the history of every man's bread, and th.@ ways by which he is to come by it. Like a bird which alights nowhere, but hops perpetually from bough to bough, is the Power which abides in no man and in no woman, but for a moment speaks from this one, and for another moment from that one.

We, I think, in these times, have had lessons enough of the futility of criticism. Our young people have thought and written much on labor and reform, and for all that they have written, neither the world nor them- selves have got on a step. Intellectual tasting of life will not supersede muscular activity. If a man should consider the nicety of the passage of a piece of bread down his throat, he would starve. At Education Fann the noblest theory of life sat on the noblest figures of young men and maidens, quite powerless and melancholy. It would not rake or pitch a ton of bay; it would not rub down a horse; and the men and maidens it left pale and hungry. A political orator wittily compared our party prom ... ises to western roads, which opened stately enough, with planted trees on either side to tempt the traveller, but soon became nar- row and narrower and ended in a squirrel ... track and ran up a 350 EX PER lEN C E tree. So does culture -vvith us; it ends in headache. Unspeakably sad and barren does life look to those who a few months ago were dazzled with the splendor of the promise of the times. \"There is now no longer any right course of action nor any self-devotion left among the Iranis.\" Objections and criticism we have had our fill of.

There are objections to every course of life and action, and the practical wisdom infers an indifferency, from the omnipresence of objection. The whole frame of things preaches indifferency. Do not craze yourself with thinking, but go about your business anywhere. Life is not intellectual or critical, but sturdy. Its chief good is for well ... mixed people who can enjoy what they find, without question. Nature hates peep- ing, and our mothers speak her very sense when they say, \"Chil- dren, eat your victuals, and say no more of it.\" To fill the hour -that is happiness; to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval. We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to skate well on them. Under the oldest mouldiest conventions a man of native force prospers just as well as in the newest world, and that by skill of handling and treatment. He can take hold anywhere. Life itself is a mixture of power and form., and will not bear the least excess of either. To finish the moment, to find the journey's end in every step of the road, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom. It is not the part of men, but of fanatics, or of mathematicians if you wilt to say that, the shortness of life considered, it is not worth caring whether for so short a duration we were sprawling in want or sitting high.

The fine young people despise life, but in me, and in such as with me are free from dyspepsia, and to whom a day is a sound and solid good, it is a great excess of politeness to look scornful and to cry for company. I am grown by sympathy a little eager and sentimental, but leave me alone and I should relish every hour and what it brought me, the potluck of the day, as heartily as the oldest gossip in the bar-room. I am thankful for small mercies. I compared notes with one of my friends who expects everything of the universe and is disappointed when anything is less than the best, and I found that I begin at the other extreme, expecting nothing, and am always full of thanks for moderate g00ds. I accept the clangor and jangle of contrary ten- dencies. I find my account in sots and bores also. They give a reality to the circumjacent picture which such a vanishing meteorous appearance can ill spare. In the morning I awake and find the old world, wife, babes and mother, Concord and Boston, the dear old spiritual world and even the dear old devil not far off.

Everything good is on the highway. The middle region of our being is the temperate zone. We may climb into the thin and cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science, or sinlt into that of sensation. Between these extremes is the equator of life, of thought, of spirit, of poetry-a narrow belt. Moreoyer, in popular experience everything good is on the highway. A col.~ j52 EXPERIENCE lector peeps into all the picture-shops of Europe for a landscape of Poussin, a crayon-sketch of Salvator; but the rrransfigura- tion, the Last Judgment, the Communion of Saint Jerome, and what are as transcendent as these, are on the walls of the Vatican, the liffizi, or the Louvre, where every footman may see them; to say nothing of Nature's pictures in every street, of sunsets and sunrises every day, and the sculpture of the human body never absent. A collector recently bought at public auction, in London, for one hundred and fifty-seven guineas, an autograph of Shakspeare; but for nothing a school-boy can read Hamlet and can detect secrets of highest concernment yet unpublished therein. I think I will never read any but the commonest books -the Bible, Homer, Dante, Shakspeare and Milton.

Right to hold land, right of property, is dis- puted, and the conventions convene, and before the vote is taken, dig away in your garden, and spend your earnings as a waif or godsend to all serene and beautiful purposes. Life itself is a bubble and a scepticism, and a sleep within a sleep. Grant it, and as much more as they will-but thou, God's darling! heed thy private dream; thou wilt not be missed in the scorning and scepticism; there are enough of them; stay there in thy closet and toil until the rest are agreed what to do about it. Thy sickness, they say, and thy puny habit require that thou do this or avoid that, but know that thy life is a flitting state, a tent for a night, and do thou, sick or well, finish that stint. Thou art sick, but shalt not be worse, and the universe, which holds thee dear, shall be the better.

Each of these elements in excess makes a mis- chief as hurtful as its defect. Everything runs to excess; every good quality is noxious if unmixed, and, to carry the danger to the edge of ruin, nature causes each man's peculiarity to superabound. Here, among the farms, we adduce the scholars as examples of this treachery. They are nature's victims of exoJ pression. You who see the artist, the orator, the poet, too near, and find their life no more excellent than that of mechanics or farmers, and themselves victims of partiality, very hollow and haggard, and pronounce them failures, not heroes, but quacks- conclude very reasonably that these arts are not for man, but are disease.

In the street and in the newspapers, life appears so plain a business that manly resolution and adherence to the multiplication-table through all weathers will insure success. But ah! presently comes a day, or is it only a half-hour, with its angel-whispering-which discomfits the conclusions of nations and of years! To-morrow again every thing looks real and angular, the habitual standards a.re reinstated, common-sense is as rare as genius-is the basis of genius, and experience is hands and feet to every enterprise; and yet, he who should do his business on this understanding would be quickly bankrupt. Power keeps quite another road than the turnpikes of choice and will; namely the subterranean and invisible tunnels and channels of life. It is ridiculous that we are diplomatists, and doctors, and considerate people; there are no dupes like these. Life is a series of surprises, and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not.

We thrive by ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 355 casualties. Our chief experiences have been casual. The most attractive class of people are those who are powerful obliquely and not by the direct stroke; men of genius, but not yet ac- credited; one get~ t~e cheer of their light without paying too great a ta.x. TheIrs IS the beauty of the bird or the morning light, and not of art. In the thought of genius there is always a surprise; and the moral sentiment is well called '-:the newness,\" for it is never other; as new to the oldest intelligence as to the young child; \"the kingdom that cometh without observation.,i In like manner, for practical success, there must not be too much design. A man will not be observed in doing that which he can do best. There is a certain magic about his properest action which stupefies your powers of observation, so that though it is done before you, you wist not of it. The art of life has a pudency, and will not be exposed. Every man is an impossibiEty until he is born; every thing impossible until we see a success.

I would gladly be moral and keep due metes and bounds, wbich I dearly love, and allow the most to the will of man; but I have set my heart on honesty in this chapter, and I can see nothing at last, in success or failure, than more or less of vital force supplied from the Eternal. The results of life are uncalculated and uncalcalable. The years teach much which the days never know. The persons who compose our company converse, and come and go, and design and execute many things, and somewhat comes of it all, but an unlooked-for result. The individual is always mistaken. He designed many things, and drew in other persons as co- adjutors, quarrelled with some or all, blundered much, and something is done; all are a little advanced, but the individual is always mistaken. It turns out somewhat new and very unlike what he promised himself. The ancients, struck with this irreducibleness of the elements of human life to calculation, exalted Chance into a divinity; but EXPERIENCE . that is to stay too long at the spark, which glitters truly at ('ne point, but the universe is warm with the latency of the same fire.

That which proceeds in suc- cession might be remembered, but that which is coexistent, or .ejaculated from a deeper cause, as yet far from being conscious; knows not its own tendency. So is it with us, now sceptical or without unity, because immersed in forms and effects all seem- ing to be of equal yet hostile value, and now religious, whilst in the reception of spiritual law. Bear with these distractions, with this coetaneous growth of the parts; they will one day be members, and obey one will. On that one will, on that secret cause, they nail our attention and hope. Life is hereby melted into an expectation or a religion. Underneath the inharmonious and trivial particulars, is a musical perfection; the Ideal jour- ne:ying always with us, the heaven without rent or seam. Do but observe the mode of our illumination. When I converse with a profound mind, or if at any time being alone I have good thoughts, I do not at once arrive at satisfactions, as when, being thirsty, I drink water; or go to the fire, being cold; no! but I am at first apprised of my vicinity to a new and excellent region of life.

But every insight from this realm of thought is felt as initial, and promises a sequel. I do not make it; I arrive there, and behold what was there already. I make! 0 no!

I am ready to die out of nature and be born again into this new yet unap .. proachable America I have found in the West: \"Since neither now nor yesterday began These thoughts, which have been ever, nor yet can A man be found who their first entrance knew.\" If I have described life as a flux of moods, I must now add that there is that in us which changes not and which ranks all sen- sations and states of mind. The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause. and now with the flesh of his body; life above life, in infinite degrees.

The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause. and now with the flesh of his body; life above life, in infinite degrees. The sentiment from which it sprung determines the dignity of any deed, and the question ever is, not what you have done or forborne, but at whose command you have done or for- borne it. Fortune, Minerva, Muse, Holy Ghost-these are quaint names, too narrow to cover this unbounded substance. The baffled intellect must still kneel before this cause, which refuses to be named-ineffable cause, which every fine genius has essayea to represent by some emphatic symbol, as, Thales by water, Anaximenes by air, Anaxagoras by (N o;:;~) thought, Zoroaster by fire, Jesus and the moderns by love; and the metaphor of each has become a national religion. The Chinese Mencius has not been the least successful in his generalization. \"I fully under- stand language,\" he said, \"and nourish well my vast-flowing vigor.\" \"I beg to ask what you call vast-flowing vigor?\" said his companion. \"The explanation,\" replied Menc:us, \"is diffi, ult. This vigor is supremely great, and in the highest degree unbend- ing. Nourish it correctly and do it no injury, and it will fin up the vacancy between heaven and earth. This vigor accords with and assists justice and reason, and leaves no hunger.\" In our more correct writing we give to this generalization the name of Bei'n.g, and thereby confess that we have arrived as far as we can go.

Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we have not arrived at a wall, but at interminable oceans. Our life seems not present so much as prospective; not for the affair~ on whi'\"'ll it EXPERIENCE is ~lasted but as a hint of this vast-flowing vigor. Most of life seems to be mere advertisement of faculty; information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap; that we are very great. So, in particulars, our greatness is always in a tendency or direction, not in an action. It is for us to believe in the rule, not in the exception. The noble are thus known from the ignoble. So in accepting the leading of the sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the immortality of the soul or the like, but the uni- versal impulse to believe, that is the material circumstance and is the principal fact in the history of the globe. Shall we describe this cause as that whicr works directly? The spirit is not help- less or needful of mediate organs. It has plentiful powers and direct effects. I am explained without explaining, I am felt with- out acting, and where I am not. Therefore all just persons are satisfied with their own praise. They refuse to explain themselves, and are content that new actions should do them that office.

Thus journeys the mighty Ideal before us; it never was known to fall into the rear j No man ever came to an experience which was satiating, but his good is tid- ings of a better. Onward and onward! In liberated moments we know that a new picture of life and duty is already possible; the elements already exist in many minds around you of a doc- trine of life which shall transcend any written record we have. The new statement will comprise the scepticisms as well as the faiths of society, and out of unbeliefs a creed shall be formed. For scepticisms are not gratuitous or lawless, but are limitations of the affirmativ'e statement, and the new philosophy must take them in.and make affirmations outside of them, just as much as it must mclude the oldest beliefs.

Per .. haps these subject-lenses have a creative power; perhaps there are no objects. Once we lived in what we saw; now, the rapacious. ness of this new power, which threatens to absorb all things, engages us. Nature, art, persons, letters, religions, objects, suc- cessively tumble in, and God is but one of its ideas. Nature and literature are subjective phenomena; every evil and every good thing is a shadow which we cast. The street is full of bumilia .. tions to the proud. As the fop contrived to dress his bailiffs in his livery and make them wait on his guests at table, so the chagrins which the bad heart gives off as bubbles, at once take form as ladies and gentlemen in the street, shopmen or bar .. keepers in hotels, and threaten or insult whatever is threatenable and insultable in us. 'T is the same with our idolatries. People forget that it is the eye which makes the horizon, and the round ... ing mind's eye which makes this or that man a type or repre- sentative of humanity, with the name of hero or saint. Jesus! the \"providential man,\" is a good man on whom many people are agreed that these optical laws shall take effect. By love on one part and by forbearance to press objection on the other part, it is for a time settled that we will look at him in the centre of the horizon, and ascribe to him the properties that will attach to any man so seen. But the longest love", "love on one part and by forbearance to press objection on the other part, it is for a time settled that we will look at him in the centre of the horizon, and ascribe to him the properties that will attach to any man so seen. But the longest love or aversion has a speedy term. The great and crescive self, rooted in absolute nature, sup- plants all relative existence and ruins the kingdom of mortal friendship and love. Marriage (in what is called the spiritual world) is impossible, because of the inequality between every subject and every object. The subject is the receiver of Godhead 7 and at every comparison must feel his being enhanced by that cryptic might. Though not in energy, yet by presence, this maga- zine of substance cannot be otherwise than felt; nor can any force of intellect attribute to the object the proper deity which E Y. ' ~ )l.

We permit all things to ourselves, and that which we call sin in ot'ners is experii11e'l! for us.

Especially the crimes that spring from love seem right and fair from the actor's point of view, but when acted are found destructive of society. No man at last believes that be can be lost, or that the crime in him is as black as in the felon. Because the intellect qualifies in our own case the moral judgments.

If you come to absolutes, pray who does }:SSAYS: SECOND SERIES not steal? Saints are sad, because they behold sin (even when they speculate) from the point of view of the conscience, and not of the intellect; a confusion of thought. Sin, seen from the thought, is a diminution, or less; seen from the conscience or will, it is pravity or bad. The intellect names it shade, absence of light, and no essence. The conscience must feel it as essence, essential evil. This it is not; it has an objective existence, but no subjective. Thus inevitably does the universe wear our color, and every object fall successively into the subject itself. The subject exists, the subject enlarges; all things sooner or later fall into place. As I am, so I see; use what language we will, we can never sav anything but what' we are; Hermes, Cadmus, Columbus, Ne~\u00ad ton, Bonaparte, are the mind's ministers.

The partial action of each strong mind in one direction is a telescope for the objects on which it is pointed. But every other part of knowledge is to be pushed to the same extravagance, ere the soul attains her due sphericity. Do you see that kitten chasing so prettily her own tail? If you could look with het eyes you might see her surrounded with hundreds of figures per- forming complex dramas, with tragic and comic issues, long can .. versations, many characters, many ups and downs of fate-and meantime it is only puss and her tail. How long before our masquerade will end its noise of tambourines, laughter and shout- ing, and we shall find it was a solitary performance? A subject and an object-it takes so much to make the galvanic circuit complete, but magnitude adds nothing. What imports it whether it is Kepler and the sphere, Columbus and America, a reader and his book, or puss with her tail? It is true that all the muses and love and religion hate these developments, and will find a way to punish the chemist who publishes in the parlor the secrets of the laboratory. And we lannot say too little of our constitutional necessity of seeing things under private aspects, or saturated with our humors. And EXPERIENCE Jet is the God the native of these bleak rocks.

And EXPERIENCE Jet is the God the native of these bleak rocks. That need makes in morals the capital virtue of self-trust. We must hold hard to this poverty, however scandalous, and by more vigorous self- recoveries after the sallies of action, possess our axis more firmly. The life of truth is cold and so far mournful; but it is not the slaye of tears, contritions and perturbations. It does not attempt another's work, nor adopt another's facts. It is a main lesson of wisdom to know your own from another's. I have learned that I cannot dispose of other people's facts; but I possess such a key to my o'wn as persuades me, against all their denials, that they also have a key to theirs. A sympathetic person is placed in the dilemma of a swimmer among drowning men, who all catch at him, and if he give so much as a leg or a finger they will drown him. They wish to be saved from the mischiefs of their vices, ':lut not from their vices. Charity would be wasted on this poor waiting on the symptoms. A wise and hardy physician will say, Conte out oj that, as the first condition of advice. In this our talking America we are ruined by our good nature and listening on all sides. This compliance takes away the power of being greatly useful. A man should not be able to look other than directly and forthright. A preoccupied attention is the only answer to the importunate frivolity of other people; an atten- tion, and to an aim which makes their wants frivolous.

This is a fruit-that I should not ask for a rash effect from meditations, counsels and the hiving of truths. I should feel it pitiful to demand a result on this town and county, an overt effect on the instant month and year. The effect is deep and secular as the cause. It work& on periods in which mortal lifetime is lost. All I know is recep- tion; I am and I have: but I do not get, and when I have fancied I had gotten anything, I found I did not. I worship with wonder the great Fortune. My reception has been so large, that I am not annoyed by receiving this or that superabundant1y. I say to the Genius, if he will pardon the proverb, In for a n'till, in for a 1nillion. When I receive a new gift, I do not macerate my body to make the account square, for if I should die I could not make the account square. The benefit overran the merit the first day, and has overrun the merit ever since. The merit itself, so-called, I reckon part of the receiving. Also that hankering after an overt or practical effect seems to me an apostasy. In good earnest I. am willing to spare this most unnecessary deal of doing. Life wears to me a visionary face.

We must be very suspicious of the deceptions of the element of time. It takes a good deal of time to eat or to sleep, or to earn a hundred dollars, and a very little time to entertain a hope ana an insight which becomes the light of our life. We dress our garden, eat our dinners, discuss the household with our wives, and these things make no impression, are forgotten next week; but, in the solitude to which every man is always returning, he has a sanity and revelations which in his passage into new worlds he will carry with him. Never mind the ridicule, never mind the defeat; up again, old heart?-it seems to say-there is victory yet for all justice; and the true romance which the world exists to real- ize will be the transformation of genius into practical power.

Work of his hand He nor commends nor grieves: Pleads for itself the fact; As unrepenting Nature leaves Her every act.

The Gracchi, Agis, Cleomenes, and others of Plutarch's heroes, do not in the record of facts equal their own fame. Sir Philip , Sidney, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh, are men of great figure and of few deeds. We cannot find the smallest part of the personal weight of Washington in the narrative of his exploits. The authority of the name of Schiller is too great for his books, This inequality of the reputation to the works or the anecdotes is not accounted for by saying that the reverberation is longer than the thunder-clap, but somewhat resided in these men which begot an expectation that outran all their performance. The largest part of their power was latent. This is that which we caU Character-a reserved force, which acts directly by presence 365 CHARACTER and without means. It is conceived of as a certain undemonstrable force, a Familiar or Genius, by whose impulses the man is guided, but whose counsels he cannot impart; which is company for him so that such men are often solitary, or if they chance to be , social, do not need society but can entertain themselves very well alone.

But to use a more modest illustration and nearer home, I observ'e that in our political elections, where this element, if it appears at all, can only occur in its coarsest form, we suffi- ciently understand its incumparable rate. The people know that they need in their representative much more than taient, namely the power to make his talent trusted.

Our frank count trymen of the west and south have a taste for character, and like to know whether the New Englander is a substantial man, or whether the hand can pass through him. The same motive force appears in trade. There are geniuses in trade, as well as in war, or the State, or letters; and the reason why this or that man is fortunate is not to be told. It lies in the man; that is all anybody can tell you about it. See him and you will know as easily why he succeeds, as, if you see Napoleon, you would comprehend his fortune.

Nature seems to authorize trade, as soon as you see the natural merchant, who appears not so much a private agent as her factor and l\\Iinister of Commerce. His natural probity combines with his insight into the fabric of society to put binl above tricks, and he communicates to all his own faith that contracts are of no private interpretation. The habit of his nund is a reference to standards of natural equity and public advantage; and he inspires respect and the wish to deal with him, both for the quiet spirit of honor which attends him, and for the intellectual pastime which the spectacle of so much ability affords. This immensely stretched trade, which makes the capes of the Southern Ocean his wharves and the Atlantic Sea his famiHar port, centres in his brain only; and nobody in the universe can make his place good.

He too believes that none can supply him, and that a man must be born to trade or he cannot learn it. This virtue draws the mind more when it appears in action to ends not so mixed. It works with most energy in the smallest companies and in private relations. In all cases it is an extraor- dinary and incomputable agent. The excess of physical strength is paralyzed by it. Higher natures overpower lower ones by affecting them with a certain sleep. The faculties are locked up, and offer no resistance. Perhaps that is the universal law . When the high cannot bring up the low to itself, it benumbs it, as man charms down the resistance of the lower animals. Men exert on each other a similar occult power. How often has the influ- ence of a true master realized all the tales of magic! A river of command seemed to run down from his eyes into all those who beheld him, a torrent of strong sad light, like an Ohio or Danube, which pervaded them with his thoughts and colored all events with the hue of his mind. \"What means did you employ?\" was the question asked of the wife of Concini, in regard to her treatment of l\\iary of Medici; and the answer was, \"Only that influence which every strong mind has over a weak \\')ne.\" Cannot Cresar in irons shuffle off the irons and transfer them to the person of Hippo or Thraso the turnkey?

Now, the universe is a close or pound. All things exist in the man tinged with the manners of his soul. 'Vith what quality is in him he infuses all nature that he can reach; nor does he tend to lose himself in vastness, but, at how long 8- curve soever, all his regards return into his own good at last. He aniInates all he can, and he sees only what he animates. He encloses the world, as the patriot does his country, as a material basis for his character, and a theatre for action. A healthy soul stands united with the Just and the True, as the magnet arranges itself with the pole; so that he stands to all beholders like a transparent object betwixt them and the SUD, and whoso journeys towards the sun, journeys towards that per ... son. He is thus the medium of the highest influence to all who are not on the same level.

There is a male and a felnale, a spirit and So fact, a north and a south. Spirit is the positive, the event is the negative. Will is the north, action the south pole. Character may be ranked as hav ... ing its natural place in the north. It shares the magnetic cur- 370 CHARACTER rents of the system. The feeble souls are drawn to the south or negative pole.

What have I gained, that I no longer immolate a bull to Jove or to Neptune, or a mouse to Hecate; that I do not tremble before the Eumenides, or the Catholic Purgatory, or the Calvinistic Judgment-day-if I quake at opinion, the public opinion as we call it; or at the threat of assault, or contumely, or bad neighbors, or poverty, or mutilation, or at the rumor of revolution, or of murder? If I quake, what matters it what I quake at? Our proper vice takes form in one or another shape, according to the sex, age, or temperament of the person, and, if we are capable of fear, will readily find terrors.

In nature there are no false valuations. A pound of water in the ocean-tempest has no more gravity than in a midsummer pond. All things work exactly according to their quality and accord- ing to their quantity; attempt nothing they cannot do, except man only. He has pretension; he wishes and attempts things beyond his force. I reac1 in a book of English memoirs, \"Mr. Fox (afterwards Lord Holland) said, he must have the Treas- ury; he had served up to it, and would have it.\" Xenophon and his", "they cannot do, except man only. He has pretension; he wishes and attempts things beyond his force. I reac1 in a book of English memoirs, \"Mr. Fox (afterwards Lord Holland) said, he must have the Treas- ury; he had served up to it, and would have it.\" Xenophon and his Ten Thousand were quite equal to what they attempted, and did it; so equal, that it was not suspected to be a grand and inimitable exploit. Yet there stands that fact unrepeated, a high-water mark in military history. Many have attempted it since, and not been equal to it. It is only on reality that any power of action can be based. No institution will be better than the institutor. I knew an amiable and accomplished person who undertook a practical reform, yet I was never able to find in him the enterprise of love he took in hand. He adopted it by ear and by the understanding from the books he had been read- ing. All his action was tentative, a piece of the city carried out into the fields, and was the city still, and no new fact, and could not inspire enthusiasm. Had there been something latent in the man, a terrible un demonstrated genius agitating and embarrassing bis demeanor, we had watched for its advent. It is not enough that the intellect should see the evils and their remedy .

The bero is misconceived and misreported; he cannot therefore wait to unravel any man's blunders\u00b7 he is again on his road, adding new powers and honors to his do- main and new claims on your heart, which will bankrupt you ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 373 if you have loitered about the old things and have not kept your relation to him by adding to your wealth. New actions are the only apologies and explanations of old ones which the noble can bear to offer or to receive. If your friend has displeased you, you shall not sit down to consider it, for he has already lost all memory of the pa~sage, and has doubled his power to serve you, and ere you can rise up again will burden vou with '\" blessings. We have no pleasure in thinking of a benevolence that is only measured by its works. Love is inexhaustible, and if its estate is wasted, its granary emptied, still cheers and enriches, and the man, thougb be sleep, seems to purify the air and his house to adorn the landscape and strengthen the laws. People always recognize this difference. We know who is benevolent, by quite other means than the amount of subscription to soup- societies. It is only low merits that can be enumerated.

We know who is benevolent, by quite other means than the amount of subscription to soup- societies. It is only low merits that can be enumerated. Fear, when your friends say to you what you have done well, and say it through; but when they stand with uncertain timid looks of respect and balf-disJike, and must suspend their judgment for years to come, you may begin to hope. Those who live tc the future must always appear selfish to those who live to the present. Therefore it was droll in the good Riemer, who has written memoirs of Goethe, to make out a list of his donations and good deeds, as, so many hundred thalers given to Stilling, to Hegel, to Tischbein; a lucrative place found for Professor Voss, a post under the Grand Duke for Herder, a pension for Meyer, two professors recommended to foreign universities; etc., etc. The longest list of specifications of benefit would look very short. A man is a poor creature if he is to be measured so. For all these of course are exceptions, and the rule and hodiurnal life of a good man is benefaction. The true charity of Goethe is to be inferred from the account he gave Dr. Eckermann of the way in which he had spent his fortune. \"Each bon mot of mine has cost a purse of gold. Half a million of my own money, the fortune I inherited, my salary and the large income derived from my writings for fifty years back, have been expended to instruct me in what I now know.

Nothing but itself can copy it. A word warm from the heart enriches me. I surrender at discretion. How death-cold is literary genius before this fire of life! These are the touches that reanimate my heavy soul and give it eyes to pierce the dark of nature. I find, where I thought lnyself poor, there was I most rich. Thence comes a new intellectual exaltation, to be again rebuked by some new exhibition of character. Strange alternation of attraction and repulsion! Char- acter repudiates intellect, yet excites it; and character passes into thought, is published so, and then is ashamed before new flashes of moral worth. Character is nature in the highest form. It is of no use to ape it or to contend with it. Somewhat is possible of resistance, and of persistence, and of creation, to this power, which will foil all emulation. This masterpiece is best where no hands but nature's have been laid on it.

Two persons lately, very young children of the most high God, have given me occasion for thought. When I explored the source of their sanctity and charm for the imagina- tion, it seemed as if each answered, 'From my non-conformity; I never listened to your people's law, or to what they call their gospel, and wasted my time. I was content with the simple rural poverty of my own; hence this sweetness; my work never renlinds you of that-is pure of that.' And nature advertises me in such persons that in democratic America she will not be democratized. How cloistered and constitutionally sequestered from the market and from scandal! It was only this morning t.hdt I sent away some wild flowers of these wood-gods. They are a relief from literature-these fresh draughts from the sources of thought and sentiment; as we read, in an age of polish and criticism, the first lines of written prose and verse - ESSAYS: SrCOND SERIES 375 of a nation. How captivating is their devotion to their favorite books, whether Aeschylus, Dante, Shakspeare, or Scott, as feeling that they have a stake in that book; who touches that, touches them-and especially the totaJ solitude of the critic, the Patmos .of thought from which he writes, in unconscious .. ness of any eyes that shall ever read this writing. Could they dream on still, as angels, and not wake to comparisons and to be flattered!

Solemn friends will warn them of the danger of the head's being turned by the flourish of trumpets, but they can afford to smile. I remember th~, indignation of an eloquent Methodist at the kind admonitIons 0') a Doctor of Divinity-'My friend, a man can neither be praise(t nor insulted.' But forgive the counsels; they are very natural I remember the thought which occurred to me when some in .. genious and spiritual foreigners came to America, was, HaVf you been victimized in being brought hither?--or, prior tc that, answer me this, 'Are you victimizable?' As I have said, Nature keeps these sovereignties in her own hands, and however pertly our sermons and discipline~ would divide some share of credit, and teach that the law!' fashion the citizen, she goes her own gait and puts the wisest in the wrong. She makes very light of gospels and prophets, as one who has a great many more to produce and no excess of time to spare on anyone. There is a class of men, individuals of which appear at long intervals, so eminently endowed with insight and virtue that they have been unanimously saluted as divine, and who seem to be an accumulation of that power we consider. Divine persons are character born, or, to borrow a phrase from Napoleon., they are victory organized. They are , usually received with ill-will, because they are new and because they set a bound to the exaggeration that ha~ been made of the personality of the last divine person. Nature never rhymes her children, nor makes two men alike.

Nature never rhymes her children, nor makes two men alike. When we see a great man we fancy a resemblance to some historical person, and predict the sequel of his character and fortune; a resu It whic~ CHARACTER he is sure to disappoint. None will ever solve the problem of his character according to our prejudice, but only in his own high unprecedented way. Character wants room; must not be crowded on by persons nor be judged from glimpses got in the press of affairs or on few occasions. It needs perspective, as a great building. It may not, probably does not, form relations rapidly and we should not require rash explanation, either on the popular ethics, or on our own, of its action. I look on Sculpture as history. I do not think the Apollo and the Jove impossible in flesh and blood. Every trait which the artist recorded in stone he had seen in life, and better than his copy. \\Ve have seen many counterfeits, but we are born believers in great men. How easily we read in old books, when men were few, of the smallest action of the patriarchs. We require that a man should be so large and columnar in the landscape, that it should deserve to be recorded that he arose, and girded up his loins, and departed to such a place. The most credible pictures are those of majestic men who prevailed at their entrance, and convinced the senses; as happened to the eastern magi an who was sent to test the merits of Zertusht or -Zoroaster. \"\\\\7b.en the Yunani sage", "girded up his loins, and departed to such a place.

Then the beloved of Yezdam, the prophet Zertusht, advanced into the midst of the assenlbly. The Yunani sage, on seeing that chief, said, 'This form and this gait cannot lie, and nothing but truth can proceed from them.'\" Plato sa id it was impossible not to believe in the children of the gods, '~though they should speak without probable or neces- sary arguments.\" I should think myself very unhappy in my associates if I could not credit the best things in history. \"John Bradshaw,\" says l\\1i1ton, \"appears like a consul from whom the fasces are not to depart with the year\u00b7 so th~t not on the tribunal only, but throughout his life, yo~ would regard him as sitting in judgment upon kings.\" I find it more credible . .. .

He who confronts the gods, without any misgivings, knows heaven; he who waits a hundred aO'es until c1 sage comes, without doubting, knows men. Hence the virtu ... ous prince moves, and for ages shows empire the way.\" But there is no need to seek remote examples. He is a dull observer whose experience has not taught him the reality and force of magic, as well as of chemistry. The coldest p;ecisian cannot go abroad without encountering inexplicable influences. One lr'an fastens an eye on him and the graves of the memory render up their dead; the secrets that make him wretched either to keep or to betray must be yielded; another, and he cannot speak, and the bones of his body seem to lose their cartilages; the entrance of a friend adds grace, boldness and eloquence to him; and there are persons he cannot choose but remember, who gave a transcendent expansion to his thought, and kindled an- other life in his bosom. What is so excellent as strict relations of amity, when they spring from this deep root? The sufficient reply to the skeptic who doubts the power and the furniture of man, is in that possibility of j0yful intercourse with persons, which makes the faith and practice of all reasonable men. I know nothing which life has to offer so satisfying as the profound good understanding which can subsist, after much exchange of good offices, between two virtuous men, each of whom is sure of himself and sure of his friend. It is a happiness which postpones all other gratifi- cations, and makes politics, and commerce, and churches, cheap ..

It is a happiness which postpones all other gratifi- cations, and makes politics, and commerce, and churches, cheap .. For when men shall meet as they ought, each a benefactor, a shower of stars, clothed with thoughts, with deeds, with ac-- complishments, it should be the festival of nature which all things announce. Of such friendship, love in the sexes is the first symbol, as all other things are symbols of love. Those relations to the best men, which, at one time, we reckoned the romances of youth, become, in the progress of the char ... acter, the most solid enjoyment. If it were possible to live in right relations with menI-if we CHARACTER iould abstain from asking anything of them, from asking their praise, or help, or pity, and content us with compelling them through the virtue of the eldest laws! Could we ~ot deal with a few persons-with one person-after the unwrItten statutes, and make an experiment of their efficacy? Could we not pay our friend the compliment of truth, of silence, of forbearing? Need we be so eager to seek him? If we are related, we shall meet. It was a tradition of the ancient world that no metamor- pbosis could hide a god from a god; and there is a Greek verse which runs- \"The Gods are to each other not unknown.\" Friends also follow the laws of divine necessity; they gravitate to each other, and cannot otherwise:- ,Vhen each the other shall avoid, Shall each by each be most enjoyed. Tne~ relation is not made, but allowed. The gods must seat themselves without seneschal in our Olympus, and as they can instal themselves by seniority divine.

The gods must seat themselves without seneschal in our Olympus, and as they can instal themselves by seniority divine. Society is spoiled if pains are taken, if the associates are brought a mile to meet. And if it be not society, it is a mischievous, low, degrading jangle, though made up of the best. All the greatness of each is kept back and every foible in painful activity, as if the Olympians should meet to exchange snuff -boxes. Life goes headlong. We chase some flying scheme, or we are bunted by some fear or command behind us. But if suddenly we encounter a friend, we pause; our heat and hurry look foolish enough; now pause, now possession is required, and the power to swell the moment from the resources of the heart. The mo- ment is all, in all noble relations. A di \\ine person is the prophecy of the mind; a friend is the hope of the heart. Our beatitude waits for the fulfilment of these two in one. The ages are opening this moral force. All force is the shadow or symbol of that. Poetry is joyful and strong as it draws its inspiration thence. Men write their names on the world as they are filled with this. History has been mean; I ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 379 our nations have been mobs; we have never seen a man: that divine form we do not yet know, but only the dream and prophecy of such: we do not know the majestic manners '\\vhich belong t(l him, which appease. and ~xalt the beholder. \\Ve shall one day see that the mos~ prIvate IS", "mobs; we have never seen a man: that divine form we do not yet know, but only the dream and prophecy of such: we do not know the majestic manners '\\vhich belong t(l him, which appease. and ~xalt the beholder. \\Ve shall one day see that the mos~ prIvate IS the most public energy, that quality atones for quantIty, and grandeur of character acts in the dark and succors them who never saw it. What greatness has yet ap~ peared is beginnings and encouragen1ents to us in this direc- tion. The history of those gods and saints which the world has written and then worshipped, are documents of character .. The ages have exulted in the manners of a youth who owe,;' nothing to fortune, and who was hanged at the Tyburn of his nation, who, by the pure quality of his nature, shed an epic splendor around the facts of his death which has transfigured every particular into an universal symbol for the eyes of man- kind. This great defeat is hitherto our highest fact. But the mind requires a victory to the senses; a force of character which will convert judge, jury, soldier and king; which will rule ani ... mal and mineral virtues, and blend with the courses of sap, of rivers, of winds, of stars, and of moral agents. If we cannot attain at a bound to these grandeurs, at least let US do them homage. In society, high advantages are set down to the possessor as disadvantages.

Is there any religion but this, to know that wherever in the wide desert of being the holy sentiment we cherish has opened into a flower, it blooms for me? if none sees it, I see it; I am aware, if I alone, of the greatness of the fact.

There are many eyes that can detect and honor the prudent and household virtues; there are many that can discern Genius on his starry track, though the mob is incapable; but when that love which is all-suffering, all-abstaining, all-inspiring, which has vowed to itself that it will be a wretch and also a fool in this world sooner than soil its white hands by any compliances, comes into our streets and houses-only the pure and aspiring can know its face, and the only compliment they can pay it is to own it.

HALF the world, it is said, knows not how the other half live. Our Exploring Expedition saw the Feejee islanders getting their dinner off human bones; and they are said to eat their own wives and children. The husbandry of the modern inhabi ... tants of Gournou (west of old Thebes) is philosophical to a fault. To set up their housekeeping nothing is requisite but two or three earthen pots, a stone to grind meal, and a mat which is the bed. The house, namely a tomb, is ready without rent or taxes. No rain can pass through the roof, and there is no door,. for there is no want of one, as there is nothing to lose. If the house do not please them, they walk out and enter another,. as there are several hundreds at their command. \"It is some- what singular,\" adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this account, \"to talk of happiness among people who live in sepulchres: among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they know nothing of.\" In the deserts of Borgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves,", "their command. \"It is some- what singular,\" adds Belzoni, to whom we owe this account, \"to talk of happiness among people who live in sepulchres: among the corpses and rags of an ancient nation which they know nothing of.\" In the deserts of Borgoo the rock-Tibboos still dwell in caves, like cliff-swallows, and the language of 381 MANNERS these negroes is compared by their neighbors to the shrieking of bats and to the whistling of birds.

But the sale, the dates, the ivory, and the gold, for which these horrible regions are visited, find their way into countries where the purchaser and consumer can hardly be ranked in one race with these cannibals and man-stealers; countries where man serves himself with metals, wood, stone, glass, gum, cotton, silk and wool; honors himself with architecture; writes laws, and contrives to execute his will through the hands of many nations; and, especially, establishes a select society, running through all the countries of intelligent men, a self-constituted aristocracy, or fraternity of the best, which, without written law or exact usage of any kind, perpetuates itself, colonizes every new-planted island and adopts and makes its OVV\"11 what- ever personal beauty or extraordinary native endowment any- where appears.

There is something equivocal in all the words in use to ex .. press the excellence of manners and social cultivation, because the quantities are fluxional, and the last effect is assumed by the senses as the cause. The word gentleman has not any cor ... relative abstract to express the quality. Gentility is mea~, and gentilesse is obsolete. But we must keep alive in the vernacular the distinction between fashion, a word of narrow and often sinister meaning, and the heroic character which the gentlema1f! imports. The usual words, however, must be respected; they will be found to contain the root of the matter. The point ot distinction in all this class of names, as courtesy, chivalry, fash\u00b7. ion, and the like, is that the flower and fruit, not the graiL of the tree, are contemplated. It is beauty which is the aim this time, and not worth. The result is now in question, althougb our words intimate well enough the popular feeling that the appearance supposes a substance. The gentleman is a man of truth, lord of his own actions, and expressing that lordship in his behavior; not in any manner dependent and servile, either on persons, or opinions, or Q?ossessions. Beyond this fact of truth and real force, the word denotes good-nature or benevo- lence: manhood first, and then gentleness. The popular notion certainly adds a condition of ease and fortune; but that is a natural result of personal force and love, that they should pos- sess and dispense the goods of the world.

In times of violence, every eminent person must fall in with many opportunities to approve his stoutness and worth; therefore every man's name that emerged at all from the mass in the feudal ages rattles in our ear like a flourish of trumpets. But personal force never goes out of fashion. That is still paramount to-day, and in the MANNERS moving crowd of good society the men of valor and reality are known and rise to their natural place. The competition is trans- ferred from war to politics and trade, but the personal force .appears readily enough in these new arenas. Power first, or no leading class. In politics and in trade, bruisers .and pirates are of better promise than talkers and clerks. God knows that all sorts of gentlemen knock at the door; but when- \u00b7ever used in strictness and with any emphasis, the name will be found to point at original energy. It describes a man stand- ing in his own right and working after untaught methods. In a good lord there must first be a good animal, at least to the extent of yielding the incomparable advantage of animal spirits. The ruling class must have more, but they must have these, \u00b7giving in every company the sense of power, which makes things easy to be done which daunt the wise.

But memory is a pase mendicant with basket and badge, in the presence of these sudden masters. The rulers of society must be up to the work of the world, and equal to their versatile office: men of the right Cresarian pattern, who have great range of affinity. I am far from believing the timid maxim of Lord Falkland e'that for ceremony there must go two to it; since a bold _~ellow will go through the cunningest forms\"), and am of opinion t.hat the gentleman is the bold fellow whose forms are not to be ,broken through; and only that plenteous nature is rightful mas- 1er which is the complement of whatever person it converses with. :\\Iy gentleman gives the law where he is; he will outpray :saints in chapel, outgeneral veterans in the field, and outshine all courtesy in the hall.

Money is not essential, but this wide affinity is which transcends the habits of clique and caste and makes it~elf feI~ by men of all classes. If the aristocrat is only valid in fashionable tircles and not with truckmen, he will never be a leader in fashion; and if the man of the people cannot speak on equal terms with the gentleman, so that the gentleman shall perceive that he is already really of his own order, he is not to be feared. Diogenes, Socrates, and Epaminondas, are gentlemen of the best blood who have chosen the condition of poverty when that of wealth was equally open to them. I use these old names, but the men I speak of are my contemporaries. Fortune will not supply to every generation one of these well-appointed knights, but every collection of men furnishes some example of the class; and the politics of thjs country, and the trade of every town, are controlled by these hardy and irresponsible doers, who have invention to take the lead, and a broad sympathy which puts them in fellowship with crowds, and makes their action popular.

The good forms, the happiest expressions of each, are repeated and adopted. By swift consent everything superfluous is dropped, everything graceful is renewed. Fine manners show themselves formidable to the uncultivated man. They are a subtler science of defence to parry and intimidate; but once matched by the skill of the other party, they dro~ the point of the sword-points and fences disappear, and the youth finds hiu1self in a more transparent atmosphere, wherein life is a less troublesome game, and not a misunderstanding 386 MANNERS rises between the players. Manners aim to facilitate life) to get rid of impediments and bring the man pure to energize. They aid our dealing and conversation as a railway aids travelling, by aettina rid of all avoidable obstructions of the road and o ~ leaving nothing to be conquered but pure space. These forms very soon become fixed, and a fine sense of propriety is culti- vated with the more heed that it becomes a badge of social and civil distinctions. Thus grows up Fashion, an equivocal semblance, the most puissant, the most fantastic and frivolous, the most feared and followed, and which morals and violence assault in vain .. There exists a strict relation between the class of power and the exclusive and polished circles. The last are always filled or filling from the first.

The strong men usually give some allowance even to the petulances of fashion, for that affinity they find in it. Napoleon, child of the revolution, destroyer of the old noblesse, never cea3ed to court the Faubourg St. Germain; doubtless with the feeling that fashion is a homage to men of his stamp. Fashion, though in a strange way, represents all manly virtue. It is virtue gone to seed: it is a kind of posthumous honor. It does not often caress the great, but the children of the great: it is a hall of the Past. It usually sets its face against the great of this hour. Great men are not commonly in its halls; they are absent in the field: they are working, not triumphing. Fashion is made up of their children; of those who through the value and virtue of somebody, have acquired lustre to their name, marks Df distinction, means of cultivation and generosity, and in their physical organization a certain health and excellence which secure to them, if not the highest power to work, yet high power to enjoy. The class of power, the working heroes, the Cortez, the X elson, the Napoleon, see that this is the festivity and per- mament celebration of such as they; that fashion is funded tal- ent; is :\\lenco, 1Iarengo and Trafalgar beaten out thin; that the brilliant names of fashion run back. to just such busy names as their own, fiity or sixty years ago.

The city would have died out, rotted and exploded, long ago, but that it was rein- forced from the fields. It is only country which came to town day before yesterday that is city and court to-day. Aristocracy and fashion are certain inevitable results. These' mutual selections are indestructible. If they provoke anger in the least favored class, and the excluded majority revenge them- selves on the excluding miJ.1ority by the strong hand and kill them, at once a new class finds itself at the top, as certainly as cream rises in a bowl of nlilk: and if the people should destroy class after class, until two men only were left, one of these would be the leader and would be involuntarily served and copied by the other.

Fashion understands itself; good-breeding and personal superiority of whatever country readily fraternize with those of every other. The chiefs of savage tribes have distinguished themselves in London and Paris by the purity of their tournure. To say what good of fashion we can, it rests on reality, and hates nothing so much as pretenders; to exclude and mystify pretenders and send them into everlasting 'Coventry,' is its delight. We contemn in turn every other gift of men of the world; but the habit even in little and the least matters of not appeal .. ing to any but our own sense of propriety, constitutes the founda .. tion of all chivalry. There is almost no kind of self-reliance, 00 it be sane and proportioned, which fashion does not occa- sionally adopt and give it the freedom of its saloons. A sainted Joul is always elegant, and, if it will, passes unchallenged into the most guarded ring. But so will Jock the teamster pass, in some crisis that brings him thither, and find favor, as long as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance, and the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and cotillons.

There will always be in society certain persons who are mer. curies of its approbation, and whose glance will at any time determine for the curious their standing in the world. These are the chatnberlains of the lesser gods. Accept their coldness as an omen of grace with the loftier deities, and allow them all their privilege. They are clear in their office, nor could they be thus formidable without their own merits. But do not measure the importance of this class by their pretension, or imagine that a fop can be the dispenser of honor and shame. They pass also at their just rate; for how can they otherwise, in circles which exist as a sort of herald's office for the sifting of character? As the first thing man requires of man is reality, so that appears in all the forms of society. We pointedly, and by name, introduce the parties to each other.

It was therefore a very natural point of old feudal etiquette that a gentlenlan who received a visit, though it were of his sovereign, should not leave his roof, but should wait his arrival at the door of his house. No house, though it were the Tuileries or the Escurial, is good for anything without a master. And yet we are not often gratified by this hospitality. Everybody we know surrounds himself with a fine house, fine books, conservatory, gardens, equipage and all manner of toys, as screens to interpose between himself and his guest. Does it not seem as if man was of a very sly, elusive nature, and dreaded nothing so much as a full rencontre front to front with his fellow? It were unmerciful, I know, quite to abolish the use of these screens, which are of eminent con- venience, whether the guest is too great or too little.

Or if perchance a searching realist comes to our gate, before whose eye we have no care to stand, then again we run to our curtain, and hide ourselves as Adam at the voice of the Lord God in the garden. Cardinal Caprara, the Pope's legate at Paris, defended himself from the glances of Napoleon by an immense pair of green spectacles. Napoleon remarked them, and speedily managed to rally them off: and yet Napoleon, in his tum, was not great enough, with eight hundred thousand troops at his back, to face a pair of free- born eyes, but fenced himself with etiquette and within triple barriers of reserve; and, as all the world knows from Madame de StaeI, was wont, when he found himself observed, to dis- charge his face of all expression. But emperors and rich men are by no means the most skilful masters of good manners.

The complement of this graceful self-respect, and that of all the points of .good-breeding I most require and insist upon, is deference. I lIke that every chair should be a throne, and hold a king. I prefer a tendency to state1ine~s to an excess of fellowship. Let the incommunicable objects of nature and the metaphysical isolation of man teach us independence. Let us not be too much acquainted.

A gentleman makes no noise; a lady is serene. Proportionate is our disgust at those invaders who fill a studious house with blast and running, to secure some paltry convenience. Not less I dislike a low sym- pathy of each with his neighbor's needs. Must we have a good understanding with one another's palates? as foolish people who have lived long together know when each wants salt or sugar.

Every natural function can be dignified by deliberation and privacy. Let us leave hurry to slaves. The compliments and ceremonies of our breeding should recall, however remotely, the grandeur of our destiny. The flower of courtesy does not very well bide handling, but if we dare to open another leaf and explore what parts go to its conformation, we shall find also an intellectual quality. To the leaders of men, the brain as well as the flesh and the heart must furnish a proportion. Defect in manners is usually the defect of fine perceptions. Men are too coarsely made for the delicacy of beautiful carriage and customs.

I could better eat with one who did not respect the truth or the laws than with a sloven and unpresentable person. l\\:Ioral qualities rule the world, but at short distances the senses are despotic. The same discrimination of fit and fair runs out, if with less rigor, into all parts of life. The average spirit of the energetic class is good sense, acting under certain limitations and to certain ends. It entertains every natural gift. Social in its nature, it respects everything which tends to unite men. It delights in measure. The love of\u00b7 beauty is mainly the love of measure or proportion. The person who screams, or uses the superlative degree, or converses with heat, puts whole draw- ing-rooms to flight. If you wish to be loved, love measure. You must have genius or a prodigious usefulness if you will hide the want of measure. This perception comes in to polish and perfect the parts of the social instrument. Society will pardon much to genius and special gifts, but, being in its nature a convention, it loves what is conventional, or what belongs to coming together.

Therefore besides personal force and so much perception as constitutes unerring taste, society demands in its patrician class another element already intimated, which it significantly terms good-nature-expressing all degrees of generosity, from the lowest willingness and faculty to oblige, up to the heights of magnanimity and love. Insight we must have, or we shall run against one another and miss the way to our food; but intellect is selfish and barren. The secret of success in society is a certain heartiness and sympathy. A man who is not happy in the com- pany cannot find any word in his memory that will fit the occa- sion. All his information is a little impertinent. A man who is happy there, finds in every turn of the conversation equally lucky occasions for the introduction of that which he has to say. The favorites of society, and what it calls whole souls, are able men and of more spirit than wit, who have no uncomfortable ego- tism, but who exactly fill the hour and the company; contented and contenting, at a marriage or ~ funeral, a ball or a jury, 394 MANNERS a water-party or a shooting-match.

Another anecdote is so close to my matter, that I must hazard'the story. A tradesman who had long dunned him for a note of three hundred guineas, found him one day counting gold, and demanded payment. \"No,\" said Fox, \"lowe this money to Sheridan; it is a debt of honor; if an accident should happen to me, he has nothing to show.\" \"Then,\" said the creditor, \"I change my debt into a debt of honor,\" and tore the note in pieces. Fox thanked the man for his confidence and paid him, saying, \"his debt was of older standing, and Sheridan must wait.\" Lover of liberty, friend of the Hindoo, friend of the African slave, he possessed a great personal popularity; and Napoleon said of him on the occasion of his visit to Paris, in 1805, \"Mr. Fox will always hold the first place in an assembly at the Tuileries.\" \"Te may easily seem ridiculous in our eulogy of courtesy, whenever we insist on benevolence as its foundation.

Fashion, which affects to be honor, is often, in all men's experience, only a ballroom code. Yet so long as it is the highest circle in the imagination of the best heads on the planet, there is something necessary and excellent in it; for it is not to be supposed that men have agreed to be the dupes of anything preposterous; and the respect which these mysteries inspire in the most rude and sylvan characters and the curi- osity with which details of high life are read betray the uni ... versality of the love of cultivated manners.

Another mode is to pass through all the degrees, spending a year and a day in St. Michael's Square, being steeped in Cologne water, and perfumed, and dined, and introduced, and properly grounded in all the biog- raphy and politics and anecdotes of the boudoirs. Yet these fineries may have grace and wit. Let there be gro- tesque sculpture about the gates and offices of temples. Let the creed and commandments even have the saucy homage of parody.

Real service will not lose its nobleness. All generosity is not merely French and sentimental; nor is it to be concealed that living blood and a passion of kindness does at last dis- tinguish God's gentleman from Fashion's. The epitaph of Sir Jenkin Grout is not wholly unintelligible to the present age: \"Here lies Sir Jenkin Grout, who loved his friend and per- :;uaded his enemy: what his mouth ate, his hand paid for: what his servants robbed, he restored: if a woman gave him pleasure, he supported her in pain: he never forgot his children; and whoso touched his finger, drew after it his whole body.\" Even the line of heroes is not utterly extinct. There is still ever some admirable person in plain clothes, standing on the wharf, who jumps in to rescue a drowning man; there is still some absurd inventor of charities; some guide and comforter of runaway slaves: some friend of Poland; some Philhellene; some fanatic who plants shade-trees for the second and third generation, and orchards when he is grown old; some well-concealed piety; some just man happy in an ill fame; some youth ashamed of the favors of fortune and impatiently casting them on other shoul- ders.

The persons who constitute the natural aristocracy are not found in the actual aristocracy, or only on its edge; as the chemical energy of the spectrum is found to be greatest just outside of the spectrum. Yet that is the infirm- ity of the seneschals, who do not know their sovereign when he 3ppears. The theory of society supposes the existence and sov- ereignty of these. It divines afar off their coming.

And this is constituted of those persons in whom heroic dispositions are native; with the love of beauty, the delight in society, and the power to embellish the passing day. If the individuals who compose the purest circles of aristoc- racy in Europe, the guarded blood of centuries, should pass in review, in such manner as that we could at leisure and critically inspect their behavior, we might find no gentleman and no lady; for although excellent specimens of courtesy and high-breeding would gratify us in the assemblage, in the particulars we should detect offence. Because elegance comes of no breeding, but of birth. There must be romance of character, or the most fas- tidious exclusion of impertinencies will not ~vail. It must be genius which takes that direction: it must be not courteous, but courtesy. High behavior is as rare in fiction as it is in fact. Scott is praised for the fidelity with which he painted the de- meanor and conversation of the superior classes. Certainly, kings and queens, nobles and great ladies, had some right to complain of the absurdity that had been put in their mouths before the days of Waverley; but neither does Scott's dialogue bear criti- cism.

In Shakspeare alone the speakers do not strut and bridle, the dialogue is easily great, and he adds to so many titles that of being the best-bred man in England and in Christendom. Once or twice in a lifetime we are permitted to enjoy the charm of n<;>ble manners, in the pres- ence of a man or woman who have no bar in their nature, but MANNERS whose character emanates freely in their word and gesture. A beautiful form is better than a beautiful face; a beautiful be- havior is better than a beautiful form: it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures; it is the finest of the fine arts. A man is but a little thing in the midst of the objects of nature, yet, by the moral quality radiating from his countenance he may abolish all considerations of magnitude, and in his manners equal the majesty of the world. I have seen an individual whose mannem, though wholly within the conventions of elegant society, were never learned there, but were original and commanding and held out protection and prosperity; one who did not need the aid of a court-suit, but carried the holiday in his eye; who ex ... hilarated the fancy by flinging wide the doors of new modes of existence; who shook off the captivity of etiquette, with happy, spirited bearing, good-natured and free as Robin Hood; yet with the port of an emperor, if need be-calm, serious and fit to stand the gaze of millions.

The open air and the fields, the street and public chambers are the places where 1\\Ian executes his will; let him yield or divide the sceptre at the door of the house. Woman, with her instinct of behavior, instantly detects in man a love of trifles, any coldness or imbecility, or, in short, any want of that large, flowing and magnanimous deportment whi~h is indispensable as an exterior in the hall. Our American institutions have been friendly to her, and at this moment I esteem it a chief felicity of this country, that it excels in women. A certain awkward con- sciousness of inferiority in the men may give rise to the new chivalry in behalf of Woman's Rights. Certainly let her be as much better placed in the laws and in social fonns as the most zealous reformer can ask, but I confide so entirely in her in- spiring and musical nature, that I believe only herself can show us how she shall be served. The wonderful generosity of her sentiments raises her at times into heroical and godlike regions, and v'erifies the pictures of Minerva, Juno, or Polymnia; and br the firmness with which she treads her upward path, she con- VlDces the coarsest calculators that another road exists than that which their feet know.

We say things we never thought to have said; for once, our walls of habitual reserve vanished and left us at large; we were children playing with children in a wide field of flowers. Steep us, we cried, in these influences, for days, for weeks, and we shall be sunny poets and will write out in many-colored words the romance that you are. \"ras it Hafiz or Firdousi that said of his Persian Lilla, She was an ele- mental force, and astonished me by her amount of life, when I saw her day after day radiating, every instant, redundant joy and grace on all around her? She was a solvent power- ful to reconcile all heterogeneous persons into one soci- ety: like air or water, an element of such a great range of affinities that it combines readily with a thousand substances. Where she is present all others will be more than they are wont. She was a unit and whole, so that whatsoever she did, became her. She had too much sympathy and desire to please, than that you could say her manners were marked with dignity, yet DO princess could surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each occasion. She did not study the Persian grammar, nor the books of the seven poets, but all the poems of the seven seemed to b~ written upon her. For though the bias of", "manners were marked with dignity, yet DO princess could surpass her clear and erect demeanor on each occasion. She did not study the Persian grammar, nor the books of the seven poets, but all the poems of the seven seemed to b~ written upon her. For though the bias of her nature was not to thought, but to sympathy, yet was she so perfect in her own nature as to meet intellectual persons by the fulness of her heart, warming them by her sentiments; believing, as she did, that by dealing nobly with all, all would show themselves noble. I know that this Byzantine pile of chivalry or Fashion, which seems so fair and picturesque to those who look at the contem- porary facts for science or for entertainment, is not equally pleasant to all spectators. The constitution of our society nlakes it a giant's castle to the ambitious youth who have not found their names enrolled in its Golden Book, and whom it has ex- cluded from its coveted honors and privileges. They have )\u00b7et to 400 MANNERS \u2022 learn that its seeming grandeur is shadowy and relative: it is rrreat bv their allowance\u00b7 its proudest gates will fly open at the 0-' approach of their courage and virtue. For the present distress, ho~\u00b7ever, of those who are predisposed to suffer from the tyran- nies of this caprice, there are easy remedies. To remove your residence a couple of miles, or at most four, will commonly relieve the most extreme susceptibility.

For the advantages which fash- ion values are plants which thrive in very confined localities, in a few streets namely. Out of this precinct they go for nothing; are of no use in the farm, in the forest, in the market, in war, in the nuptial society, in the literary or scientific circle, at sea, in friendship, in the heaven of thought or virtue. But we have lingered long enough in these painted courts. The worth of the thing sig~ified must vindicate our taste for the emblem. Everything that is called fashion and courtesy humbles itself before the cause and fountain of honor, creator of titles and dignities, namely the heart of love. This is the royal blood, this the fire, whieh, in all countries and contingencies, will work after its kind and conquer and expand all that approaches it. This gives new meanings to every fact. This impoverishes the rich, suffering no grandeur but its own. What is rich? Are you rich enough to help anybody? to succor the unfashionable and the eccentric? rich enough to make the Canadian in his wagon, the itinerant with his consul's paper which commends him \"To the charitable,\" the swarthy Italian with his few broken words of English, the lame pauper hunted by overseers from town to town, even the poor insane or besotted wreck of man or woman, feel the noble exception of your presence and your house from the general bleakness and stoniness; to make such feel that they were greeted with a voice which made them both remember and hope? \"'bat is vulgar but to refuse the claim on acute and con- clusive reasons? ,,:nat is gentle, but to allow it, and give their heart and yours one holiday from the national caution?

Without the rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar. The king of Schiraz \"auld not afford to be so bountiful as the poor Osman who dwelt at his gate. Osman had a humanity so broad and deep that although his speech was so bold and free with the ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 401 Koran as to disgust all the dervishes, yet was there ne\\\"er a poor outcast, eccentric, or insane man, some fool who had cut off his beard, or who had been mutilated under a vow, or had a pet madness in his brain, but fled at once to him; that great heart lay there S0 sunny and hospitable in the centre of the country, that it seemed as if the instinct of all sufferers dre\\v' them to his side. And the madness which he harbored he did not share. Is not this to be rich? this only to be rightly rich? But I shall hear without pain that I play the courtier very ill, and talk of that which I do not well understand. It is easy to see that what is called by distinction society and fashion has, good laws as well as bad, has much that is necessary, and much that is absurd. Too good for banning, and too bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition of the pagan mythology, in any at- tempt to settle its character.

Too good for banning, and too bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition of the pagan mythology, in any at- tempt to settle its character. 'I overheard Jove, one day,' said Silenus, 'talking of destroying the earth; he said it had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, who went from bad to worse, as fast as the days succeeded each other. I\\linerya said she hoped not; they were only ridiculous little creatures, ,vith this odd circumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate aspect, seen far or seen near; if you called them bad, they would appear so; if you called them good, they would appear so; and there was no one person or action among them which would not puzzle her owl, much more all Olympus, to know whether it was funda., mentally bad or good.' GIFTS Gifts of one w'ho loved me- T was high time they came; ,,'ben he ceased to love me, Time they stopped for shame. IT IS said that the world is in a state of bankruptcy; that the world owes the world more than the world can pay, and ought to go into chancery and be sold. I do not think this general in- solvency, which involves in some sort all the population, to be the reason of the difficulty experienced at Christmas and New Year and other times, in bestowing gifts; since it is always S0 pleasant to be generous, though very vexatious to pay debts. But the impediment lies in the choosing. If at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody, I all' puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone.

If at any time it comes into my head that a present is due from me to somebody, I all' puzzled what to give, until the opportunity is gone. Flowers and fruits are always fit presents; flowers, because t1.ey are a proud assertion that a ray of beauty outvalues all the utilities of the world. These gay natures contrast with the somewhat stern coun- tenance of ordinary nature: they are like music heard out of a work-house. Nature does not cocker us; we are children, not pets; she is not fond; everything is dealt to us without fear or favor, after severe universal laws. Yet these delicate flowers look .like the frolic and interference of love and beauty. l\\len use to tell us that we love flattery even though we are not deceived by it, because it shows that we are of importance enough to be courted. Something like that pleasure, the flowers give us: what am I to whom these sweet hints are addressed? Fruits are ac- ceptable gifts, because they are the flower of commodities, and admit of fantastic values being attached to them. If a man should send to me to come a hundred miles to visit him and should set before me a basket of ,fine summer-fruit, I should think. there was some proportion between the labor and the reward. 402 ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES For common gifts, necessity makes pertinences and beauty every day, and one is glad when an imperative leaves him no option; since if the man at the door have no shoes, you have not to consider whether you could procure him a paint-box.

And as it is always pleasing to see a man eat bread, or drink. water, in the house or out of doors, so it is always a great satis- faction to supply these first wants. Necessity does ever:yihing well. In our condition of universal dependence it seems heroic to let the petitioner be the judge of his necessity, and to give all that is asked, though at great inconvenience. If it be a fantastic desire, it is better to leave to others the office of punishing him. I can think of many parts I should prefer playing to that of the Furies. Next to things of necessity, the rule for a gift, which one of my friends prescribed, is that we might convey to some person that which properly belonged to his character, and was easily associated with him in thought. But our tokens of compliment and love are for the most part barbarous. Rings and other jewels are not gifts, but apologies for gifts. The only gift is a portion of thyself. Thou must bleed for me. Therefore the poet brings his poem; the shepherd, his lamb; the farmer, corn; the miner, a gem; the sailor, coral and shells; the painter, his picture; the girl, a handkerchief of her own sewing.

We are either glad or sorry at a gift, and both emotions are unbecoming. Some violence I think is done, some degradation borne, when I rejoice or grieve at a gift. I am sorry when my independence is invaded, or when a gift comes from such as do not know my spirit, and so the act is not supported; and if the gift pleases me overmuch, then I should be ashamed that the donor should read my heart, and see that I love his commodity, and not him. The gift, to be true, must be the flowing of the giver unto me, correspondent to my flowing unto him. 'Vhen the waters are at level, then my goods pass to him, and his to me. All his are mine, all mine his. I say to him, How can you give me this pot of oil or this flagon of wine when all your oil and wine is mine, which belief of mine this gift seems to deny? Hence the fitness of beautiful, not use- ful things, for gifts. This giving is fiat usurpation, and therefore when the beneficiary is ungrateful, as all beneficiaries hate all Timons, not at all considering the value of the gift but looking back to the greater store it was taken from-I rather sympathize with the beneficiary than with the anger of my lord Timon. For the expectation of gratitude is mean, and is continually punished by the total insensibility of the obliged person.

Compared ,vith that good-will I bear my friend, the benefit it is in my power to render him seems small. Besides, our action on each other, good as well as evil, is so incidental and at random that we can seldom hear the acknowledgments of .any person who would thank us for a benefit, without some shame and humiliation. \\\\!e can rarely strike a direct stroke, but must be content with an oblique one; we seldom have the satisfaction of yielding a direct benefit which is directly received.

This is prerogative, and not to be limited by our municipal rules. For the rest, I like to see that we cannot be bought and sold. The best of hospitality and of generosity is also not in the will, but in fate. I find that I am not much to you; you do not need me; you do not feel me; then am I thrust out of doors, though you proffer me house and la.nds.

These balcyons may be looked for with a little mOfe assurance in that pure October weather which we distinguish by the na.me of the Indian summer. The day, im- measurably long, sleeps over the broad hills and warm wide fields. To have lived through all its sunny hours, seems longevity enough. The solitary places do not seem quite lonely.

How willingly we would escape the barriers which render them comparatively impotent, escape the sophistication and seconu thought, and suffer nature to intrance us. The tempered light of the woods is like a perpetual morning, and is stimulating and heroic. The anciently-reported spells of these places creep on us. The stems of pines, hemlocks and oaks almost gleam like iron on the excited eye .. The incommunicable trees begin to persuade us to live with them, and quit our life of solemn trifles. Here no history, or church, or state, is interpolated on the divine sky and the immortal year. How easily we might walk onward into the opening landscape, absorbed by new pictures and by thoughts fast succeeding each other, un til by degrees the recollection of home was crowded out of the mind, all memory obliterated by the tyranny of the present, and we were led in triumph by nature.

But I go with my friend to the shore of our little river, clnd with one stroke of the paddle I leave the village politics and personalities, yes, and the world of villages and personalities, behind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight, too bright almost for spotted man to enter without novitiate and probation. \\Ve penetrate bodily this incredible beauty; we dip our hands in this painted element; our eyes are bathed in these lights and forms. A holiday, a villeggiatura, a royal revel, the proudest, most heart-rejoicing festival that valor and beauty, power and taste, ever decked and enjoyed, establishes itself on the instant.

Only as far as the masters of the world have called in nature to their aid, can they reach the height of magnificence.

When the rich tax the poor with servility and obsequiousness, they should considet the effect of men reputed to be the possessors of nature, on imaginative minds. Ah! if the rich were rich as the poor fancy riches! A boy bears a military band play on the field at night, and he has kings and queens and famous chivalry palpably before him. He hears the echoes of a horn in a hill country, in the Notch l\\lountains, for example, which converts the mountains into an Aeolian harp- and this supernatural tiralira restores to him the Dorian mythol- ogy, Apollo, Diana, and all divine hunters and huntresses. Can a musical note be so lofty, so haughtily beautiful! To the poor yOUllg poet, thus fabulous is i1is picture of society; he is loyal; he respects the rich; they 3re rich for the sake of his imagina- tion; how poor his fancy would be, if they were not rich! That they have some high-fenced grove which they call a park; that they live in larger and better-garnished saloons than he has visited, and go in coaches, keeping only the society of the ele- gant, to watering-places and to distant cities-these make the groundwork from which he has delineated estates of romance, compared with which their actual possessions are shanties and paddocks.

The moral sensibility which makes Edens and Tempes so easily, may not be always found, but the material landscape is never far off. \\Ve can find these enchantments without visiting the Corao Lake, or the 1\\ladeira Islands. We exaggerate the praises of local scenery. In every landscape the point of astonishment is the meeting of the sky and the earth, and that is seen from the first hillock as well as from the top of the Alleghanies. The stars at night stoop down over the brownest, homeliest common with ~l the spiritual magnificence which they shed on the Campagna, or on the marble deserts of Egypt. The uprolled clouds and the colors of morning and evening will transfigure maples and alders. The difference between landscape and landscape is small, but there is great difference in the beholders. There is nothing so wonderful in any particular landscape as the necessity of being beautiful under which every landscape lies. Nature cannot be surprised in undress. Beauty breaks in everywhere. But it is very easy to outrun the sympathy of readers on this topic, which schoolmen called natura naturata, or nature pas- sive. One can hardly speak directly of it without excess.

I suppose this shame must have a good reason. A dilettanteism in nature is barren and unworthy. The fop of fields is no better than his brother of Broadway.

If there were good men, there would never be this rap- ture in i1ature. If the king is in the palace, nobody looks at the walls. It is w hen he is gone, and the house is filled with grooms and gazers: that we turn from the people to find relief in the majestic mer that are suggested by the pictures and the archi- tecture. The ,.:ritics who complain of the sickly separation of the beauty ot nature from the thing to be done, must consider that our hunting Oi the picturesque is inseparable from our protest against falst sr,ciety. Man is fallen; nature is erect, and serves as a differentia\u00b7 thermometer, detecting the presence or absence of the divine ~entiment in man. By fault of our dulness and sel\u00b7 fishness we are tooking up to nature, but when we are convales .. cent, nature ~Nil: look up to us. We see the foaming bruok with compunction: it our own life flowed with the right energy, we should shame the brook.

The stream of zeal sparkles with real fire, and not with reflex rays of sun and moon. Nature may be as selfishly studied as trade. Astronomy to the selfish becomes astrology; psychology, mesmerism (with intent to show where our spoons are gone); and anatomy and physiology become phrenology and palmistry. But taking timely warning, and leaving many things unsaid on this topic, let us not longer omit our homage to the Efficient Nature, natura naturans, the quick cause before which all forms flee as the driven snows; itself secret, its works driven before it in flocks and multitudes (as the ancients represented nature by 412 NATURE Proteus, a shepherd) and in undescribable variety. It publishes itself in creatures, reaching from particles and spiculre through transformation on transformation to the highest symmetries, ar- riving at consummate results without a shock or a leap. A little heat, that is a little motion, is all that differences the bald, dazzling white and deadly cold poles of the earth from the pro- lific tropical climates. _~ changes pass without violence, by rea- son of the two cardinal conditions of boundless space and bound- less time. Geology has initiated us into the secularity of nature, and taught us to disuse our dame-school measures, and exchange our l\\losaic and Ptolemaic schemes for her large style. We knew nothing rightly, for want of perspective. Now we learn what patient periods must round themselves before the rock. is formed; then before the rock. is broken, and the first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external plate into soil, and opened the door for the remote Flora, Fauna, Ceres, and Pomona to come in. How far off yet is the trilobite! how far the quadruped! how inconceivably remote is man!

How far off yet is the trilobite! how far the quadruped! how inconceivably remote is man! All duly arrive, and then race after race of men. It is a long way from granite to the oyster; farther yet to Plato and the preaching of the immortality of the soul. ): ... et all must come, as surely as the first atom has two sides. ~Iotion or change and identity or rest are the first and second secrets of nature: ~Iotion and Rest. The whole code of her laws may be written on the thumbnail, or the signet of a ring. The whirling bubble on the surface of a brook admits us to the secret of the mechanics of the sky. Every shell on the beach is a key to it. A little water made to rotate in a cup explains the formation of the simpler shells; the addition of matter from year to year arrives at last at the most comple..\"'{ forms; and yet so poor is nature ~ith all her craft, that from the beginning to the end of the universe she has but one stuff-but one stuff with its two ends, to serve up all her dream-like variety. Compound it how she will, star, sand, fire, water, tree, man, it is still one stuff, and betrays the same properties. Nature is always consistent, though she feigns to contravene her own laws ..

She keeps her laws, and seems to traD\\Scend them. ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 413 She arms and equips an animal to find its place and living in the earth, and at the same time she arms and equips another ani- mal to destroy it. Space exists to divide creatures; but by clothing the sides of a bird with a few feathers she gives him a petty omnipresence. The direction is forever onward, but the artist still goes baclt for materials and begins again with the first ele- ments on the most advanced stage: otherwise all goes to ruin. If we look at her work, we seem to catch a glance of a system in transition. Plants are the young of the world, vessels of health and vigor; but they grope ever upward towards consciousness; the trees are imperfect men, and seem to bemoan their imprison- ment, rooted in the ground. The animal is the novice and pro ... bationer of a more advanced order. The men, though young, having tasted the first drop from the cup of thought, are already dissipated; the maples and ferns are still uncorrupt; yet no doubt when they come to consciousness they too will curse and swear. Flowers so strictly belong to youth that we adult men soon come to feel that their beautiful generations concern not us: we have had our day; now let the children have theirs. The flowers jilt us, and we are old bachelors with our ridiculous tenderness.

If we had eyes to see it, a bit of stone from the city wall would certify us of the necessity that man must exist, as readily as the city. That identity makes us al' one, and reduces to nothing great intervals on our customary scale. We talk of deviations from natural life, as if artificial life were not also natural. The smoothest curled courtier in the bou- doirs of a palace has an animal nature, rude and aboriginal as a white bear, omnipotent to its own ends, and is directly related, there amid essences and billets-doux, to Himmaleh mountain .. chains and the axis of the globe .. If we consider how much we are nature's, we need not be superstitious about towns, as if that terrific or benefic force did not find us there also, and fashion cities. Nature, who made the mason, made the house. We may easily hear too much of rural influences. The cool disengaged air of natural objects makes them enviable to us, chafed and 414 NATURE irritable creatures with red faces, and we think we shall be as grand as they if we camp out and eat roots; but let us be men instead of woodchucks and the oak and the elm shall gladly serve us, though we sit in chair\u00a3 of ivory on carpets of silk.

This guiding identity runs through all the surprises and con- trasts of the piece, and characterizes every law. Man carries the world in his head, the whole astronomy and chemistry suspended in a thought. Because the history of nature is charactered in his brain, therefore is he the prophet and discoverer of her secrets. Every known fact in natural science was divined by the presentiment of somebody, before it was actually verified. A man does not tie his shoe without recognizing laws which bind the farthest regions of nature: moon, plant, gas, crystal, are concrete geometry and numbers. Common sense knows its own, and recognizes the fact at first sight in chemical experiment. The common sense of Franklin, Dalton, Davy and Black is the same common sense which made the arrangements which now it dis- covers. If the identity expresses organized rest, the counter action runs also into organization. The astronomers said, 'Give us mat- ter and a little motion and we will construct the universe. It is not enough that we should have matter, we must also have a single impUlse, one shove to launch the mass and generate the harmony of the centrifugal and centripetal forces. Once heave t.lte ball from the hand, and we can show how all this mighty (rrder grew.' 'A very unreasonable postulate,' said the meta- physicians, 'and a plain begging of the question. Could you not prevail to know the genesis of projection, as well as the continuation of it?' Nature, meanwhile, had not waited for the discussion, but, right or wrong, bestowed the impulse, and the balls rolled.

Nature, meanwhile, had not waited for the discussion, but, right or wrong, bestowed the impulse, and the balls rolled. It was no great affair, a mere push, but the astrono- mers were right in making much of it, for there is no end to the consequences of the act~ That famous aboriginal push propa- gates itself through all the balls of the system, and through Every atom of every ball; through all the races of creatures, and through the history and performances of every individual. Ex- aggeration is in the course of things. Nature sends no creature, ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES no man into the world without adding a small excess of his proper quality_Given the planet, it is still necessary to add the impulse; so to every creature nature added a little violence of direction in its proper path, a shove to put it on its way~ in every instance a slight generosity, a drop too much. Without electricity the air would rot, and without this violence of direction which men and women have, without a spice of bigot and fanatic, no excitement, no efficiency_ We aim above the mark to hit the mark. Every act hath some falsehood of exaggeration in it. And when now and then comes along some sad, sharp-eyed man, who sees how paltry a game is played, and refuses to p1a:y but blabs the secret; how then? Is the bird flown? 0 no, the wary Nature sends a new troop of fairer forms, of lordlier youths, with a little more excess of direction to hold them fast to their several aim; makes them a little wrong-headed in that direction in which they are rightest, and on goes the game again with new whirl, for a generation or two", "new troop of fairer forms, of lordlier youths, with a little more excess of direction to hold them fast to their several aim; makes them a little wrong-headed in that direction in which they are rightest, and on goes the game again with new whirl, for a generation or two more. The child with his sweet pranks, the fool of his senses, commanded by every sight and sound, '\\vithout any power to compare and rank his.sensations, abandoned to a whistle or a painted chip, to a lead dragoon or a gingerbread- dog, individualizing everything, generalizing nothing, delighted with every new thing, lies down at night overpowered by the fatigue which this day of continual pretty madness has incurred. But Nature has answered her purpose with the curly, dimpled lunatic. She has tasked every faculty, and has secured the sym- metrical growth of the bodily frame by all these attitudes and exertions-an end of the first importance, which could not b&. trusted to any care less perfect than her own. This glitter, flus opaline lustre plays round the top of every toy to his eye to insure his fidelity, and he is deceived to his good. We are made alive and kept alive by the same arts. Let the stoics say what they please, we do not eat for the good of living, but because the meat is savory and the appetite is keen. The vegetable life does not can ten t itself with casting from the flower or the tree a single seed, but it fills the air and earth with a prodigality of seeds! that, if thousands perish, thousands may plant themselves ~ that hundreds may come up, that tens may live to maturity; that at NATURE least one may replace the parent.

All things betray the same calculated profusion. The excess of fear with which the animal frame is hedged round, shrinking from cold, starting at sight 01 a snake or at a sudden noise, protects us, through a multitude ot groundless alarms, from some one real danger at last. The lover seeks in marriage his private felicity and perfection, with no prospective end; and nature hides in his happiness her own end, namely progeny, or the perpetuity of the race. But the craft with which the world is made, runs also into the mind and character of men. No man is quite sane; each has a vein of folly in his composition, a slight determination of blood to the head, to make sure of holding him hard to some one point which nature had taken to heart. Great causes are never tried on their merits; but the cause is reduced to particulars to suit the size of the partisans, and the contention is ever hottest on minor matters. Not less remarkable is the over faith of each man in the importance of what he has to do or say. The poet, the prophet, has a higher value for what he utters than any hearer, and therefore it gets spoken. The strong, self-complacent Luther declares with an emphasis not to be mistaken, that \"God himself cannot do without wise men.\" Jacob Behmen and George Fox betray their egotism in the pertinacity of their controversial tracts, and James Naylor once suffered himself to be worshipped as the Christ.

The strong, self-complacent Luther declares with an emphasis not to be mistaken, that \"God himself cannot do without wise men.\" Jacob Behmen and George Fox betray their egotism in the pertinacity of their controversial tracts, and James Naylor once suffered himself to be worshipped as the Christ. Each prophet comes presently to identify himself with his thought, and to esteem his hat and shoes sacred. How .. ever this may discredit such persons with the judicious, it helps them with the people, as it gives heat, pungency and pUblicity to their words. A similar experience is not infrequent in private life. Each young and ardent person writes a diary, in which, when the hours of prayer and penitence arrive, he inscribes his souL The pages thus written are to him burning and fragrant; he reads them on his knees by midnight and by the morning star; he wets them with bis tears; they are sacred; too good for the world, and hardly yet to be shown to the dearest friend.

After some time has elapsed, he begins to wish to admit his friend to this ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES hallowed experience, and with hesitation, yet with firmness, ex- poses the pages to his eye.

Days and nights of fervid life, of communion with angels of darkness and of light have engraved their shadowy characters 'In their tear-stained book. He suspects the intelligence or the heart of his friend. Is there then no friend? He cannot vet credit ., that one may have impressive experience and yet may not know how to put his private fact into literature: and perhaps the dis- covery that wisdom has other tongues and ministers than we, that though we should hold our peace the truth would not the less be spoken, might check injuriously the flames of our zeal. A man can only speak so long as he does not feel his speech to be partial and inadequate. It is partial, but he does not see it to be so whilst he utters it. As soon as he is released from tb.e instinctive and particular and sees its partiality, he shuts his mouth in disgust. For no man can write anything who does not think that what he \\,rites is for the time the history of the world; or do anything well who does not esteem his work to be of importance .. My work may be of none, but I must not think it of none, or I shall not do it with impunity. In like manner, there is throughout nature something mock. .. ing, something that leads us on and on, but arrives no- where; keeps no faith with us. All promise outruns the performance.

Hunger and thirst lead us on to eat and to drink.; but bread and wine, mix and cook them how you will, leave us hungry and thirsty, after the stomach is full. It is the same with all our arts and performances. Our music, our poetry, our Ian .. guage itself are not satisfactions, but suggestions. The hunger for wealth, which reduces the planet to a garden, fools the eager pursuer. What is the end sought? Plainly to secure the ends of good sense and beauty irom the intrusion of 418 NATURE deformity or vulgarity of any kind. But what an operose method! \"''''hat a train of means to secure a little conversation 1 This palace ,)f brick and stone, these servants, this kitchen, these stables, horses and equipage, this bank-stock and file of mortgages; trade to all the world, country-house and cottage by the waterside, all for a little conversation, high, clear and spiritual! Could it not be had as well by beggars on the highway? No, all these things came fiom successive efforts of these beggars to remove friction from the wheels of life, and give opportunity. Conversation, character, were the avowed ends; wealth was good as it appeased the animal cravings, cured the smoky chimney, silenced the treaking door, brought friends together in a warm and quiet room, and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different apartment.

Unluckily, in the exertions neces- sary to remove these inconveniences, the main attention has been diverted to this object; the old aims have been lost sight of, and to remove friction has come to be the end .. That is the ridicule of rich men i and Boston, London, Vienna, and now the governments generally of the world, are cities and governments of the rich; and the masses are not men, but poor men, that is, men who would be rich; this is the ridicule of the class, that they a.rrive with pains and sweat and fury nowhere; when all is done, it is for nothing. They are like one who has interrupted the con- versation of a company to make his speech, and now has forgot- ten what he went to say. The appearance strikes the eye every- where of an aimless society, of aimless nations. Were the ends of nature so great and cogent as to exact this immense sacrifice of men?

It is an odd jealousy, but the poet finds himself Dot near enough to his object. The pine-tree, the river, the bank of flowers before him does not seem to be nature. Nature is still elsewhere. This or this is but out skirt and a far-off reflection and echo of the triumph that has passed by and is now at its glancing splendor and heyday, perchance in the neighboring fields, or, if you stand in the field, then in the adjacent woods. The present object shall give you this sense of stillness that follows a pageant which has just gone by. What splendid distance, what recesses of ineffable pomp and loveliness in the sunset! But who can go where they are, or lay his hand or plant his foot thereon? Off they fall from the round world forever and ever.

Of persons, all have equal rights, in virtue of being identical in nature. This interest of course with its whole power demands a democracy_ Whilst the rights of all as persons are equal, in \"irtue of then POLITICS access to reason, their rights in property are very unequal. One man owns his clothes, and another owns a county. This accident, depending primarily on the skill and virtue of the parties, of which there is every degree, and secondarily on patrimony, falls unequally, and its rights of course are u:rn.equal. Personal rights, universally the same, demand a government framed on the ratio of the census; property demands a government framed on the ratio of O\"'llers and of owning. Laban, who has flocks and herds, wishes them looked after by an officer on the frontiers, lest the )Iidianites shall drive them off; and pays a tax to that end.

And if question arise whether additional officers or watch-towers should be provided, must not Laban and Isaac, and those who must sell part of their herds to buy protection for the rest, judge better of this, and with more right, than Jacob, who, because he is a youth and a traveller, eats their bread and not his own? In the earliest society the proprietors made their own wealth, and so long as it comes to the owners in the direct way, no other opinion would arise in any equitable community than that prop- erty should make the law for property, and persons the law for persons. But property passes through donation or inheritance to those who do not create it. Gift, in one case, makes it as really the new owner's, as labor made it the first owner's: in the other case, of patrimony, the law makes an ownership which will be valid in each man's view according to the estimate which he sets on the public tranquillity. It was not, however, found easy to embody the readily ad- mitted principle that property should make law for property, and persons for persons; since persons and property mixed them- selves in every transaction. At last it seemed settled that the rightful distinction was that the proprietors should have more elective franchise than non-proprietors, on the Spartan prin- ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES ciple of \"calling that which is just, equal; not that which is equal, just.\" That principle no longer looks so self-evident as it appeared in former times, partly because doubts have arisen whether too much weight had not been allowed in the laws to property, and", "prin- ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES ciple of \"calling that which is just, equal; not that which is equal, just.\" That principle no longer looks so self-evident as it appeared in former times, partly because doubts have arisen whether too much weight had not been allowed in the laws to property, and such a structure given to our usages as allowed the rich to en- croach on the poor, and to keep them poor; but mainly because there is an instinctive sense, however obscure and yet inarticu- late, that the whole constitution of property, on its present ten- ures, is injurious, and its influence on persons deteriorating and degrading; that truly the only interest for the consideration of the State is persons; that property will always follow persons; that the highest end of government is the culture of men; and that if men can be educated, the institutions will share their improvement and the moral sentiment will write the law of the land. If it be not easy to settle the equity of this question, the peril is less when we take note of our natural defences. \\Ve are kept by better guards than the vigilance of such magistrates as Wt~ commonly elect.

Under any forms, persons and property must and will have their just sway_ They exert their power, as steadily as mat- ter its attraction. Cover up a pound of earth never so cunnjngly, divide and subdivide it; melt it to liquid, convert it to gas; it will always weigh a pound; it will always attract and resist other matter by the full virtue of one pound weight: and the attributes of a person, his wit and his moral energy, will exercise, under any POLITICS law or extinguishing tyranny, their proper force, if not overtly, then covertly; if not for the law, then against it; if not whole .. somely, then poisonously; with right, or by might. The boundaries of personal influence it is impossible to fix, as persons are organs of moral or supernatural force. Under the dominion of an idea which possesses the minds of multitudes, as civil freedom, or the religious sentiment, the powers of persons are no longer subjects of calculation. A nation of men unani ... mously bent on freedom or conquest can easily confound the arithmetic of statists, and achieve extravagant actions, out of all proportion to their means; as the Greeks, the Saracens, the Swiss, the .Americans, and the French have done.

Democracy is better for us, because the religious sentiment of the present time accords better with it. Born democrats, we are no .. wise qualified to judge of monarchy, which, to our fathers living in the monarchical idea, was also relatively right. But our institu- tions, though in coincidence with the spirit of the age, have not any exemption from the practical defects which have discredited other forms. Every actual State is corrupt. Good men must not obey the laws too well. What satire on government can equal the severity of censure conveyed in the word politic, which now for ages has signified cunning, intimating that the State is a trick? The same benign necessity and the same practical abuse appear in the parties, into which each State divides itself, of opponents and defenders of the administration of the government.

We might as wisely reprove the east wind or the frost, as a political party, whose members, for the most part, could give no account of their position, but stand for the defence of those interests in which they find themselves. Our quarrel with them begins when they quit this deep natural ground at the bidding of some leader, and obeying personal considerations, throw themselves into the maintenance and defence of point5. nowise belonging to their system. A party is perpetually corrupted by personality. Vlhllst we absolve the association from dishon- esty, we cannot extend the same charity to their leaders. They reap the rewards of the docility and zeal of the masses which they direct. Ordinarily our parties are parties of circumstance, and not of principle; as the planting interest in conflict with the commercial; the party of capitalists and that of operatives: parties which are identical in their moral character, and which can easily change ground with each other in the support of many 'POLITICS of their measures. Parties of principle, as, religious sects, or the party of free-trade, of universal suffrage, of abolition of slavery, of abolition of capital punishment-degenerate into personalitiei, or would inspire enthusiasm.

Of the two grea: parties which at this hour almost share the nation between them, I should say that one has the best cause, and the other contains the best men. The philosopher, the poet, or the religious man, will of course wish to cast his vote with the democrat, for free-trade, for wide suffrage, for the abolition of legal cruelties in the penal code, and for facilitating in every manner the access of the young and the poor to the sources of wealth and power .. But he can rarely accept the persons whom the so-called popular party propose to him as representatives of these liberalities. They have not at heart the ends which give to the name of democracy what hope and virtue are in it. The spirit of our American radicalism is destructive and aimless: it is not loving; it has no ulterior and divine ends, but is destructive only out of hatred and selfishness. On the other side, the conserva- tive party, composed of the most moderate, able and cultivated part of the population, is timid, and merely defensive of prop- erty. It vindicates no right, it aspires to no real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no generous policy; it does not build, nor write, nor cherish the arts, nor foster religion, nor establish schools, nor encourage science, nor emancipate the slave, nor befriend", "and merely defensive of prop- erty.

From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in science, art, or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the nation. I do not for these defects despair of our republic. Weare not at the mercy of any waves of chance. In the strife of ferocious parties, human nature always finds itself cherished; as the chil- dren of the convicts at Botany Bay are found to have as healthy ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES a moral sentiment as other children. Citizens of feudal states are alarmed at our democratic institutions lapsing into anarchy, and the older and more cautious among ourselves are learning from Europeans to look with some terror at our turbulent freedom. It is said that in our license of construing the Constitution, and in the despotism of public opinion, we have no anchor; and one foreign observer thinks he has found the safeguard in the sanctity of l\\farriage among us; and another thinks he has found it in our Calvinism. Fisher Ames expressed the popular security more wisely, when he compared a monarchy and a republic saying that a monarchy is a merchantman, which sails well, but will some- times strike on a rock and go to the bottom; whilst a republic is a raft, which would never sink, but then your feet are always in water. No forms can have any dangerous importance whilst we are befriended by the laws of things. It makes", "well, but will some- times strike on a rock and go to the bottom; whilst a republic is a raft, which would never sink, but then your feet are always in water. No forms can have any dangerous importance whilst we are befriended by the laws of things. It makes no difference how many tons' weight of atmosphere presses on our heads, so long as the same pressure resists it within the lungs. Augment the mass a thousand-fold, it cannot begin to crush us~ as long as reaction is equal to action. The fact of two poles, of two forces, centripetal and centrifugal, is universal, and each force by its own activity develops the other. Wild liberty develops iron con .. science. Want of liberty, by strengthening law and decorum, stupefies conscience. 'Lynch-law' prevails only where there is greater hardihood and self-subsistency in the leaders. A mob can- not be a permanency; everybody's interest requires that it should not exist, and only justice satisfies all. We must trust infinitely to the beneficent necessity which shines through all laws. Human nature expresses itself in them as characteristically as in statues, or songs, or railroads; and an abstract of the codes of nations would be a transcript of the com- mon conscience .. Gover:mnents have their origin in the moral identity of men. Reason for one is seen to be reason for another, and for every otber. There is a middle measure which satisfies all parties; be they never so many or so resolute for their own.

In these decisions all the citizens find a perfect agreement, and only 430 POLITICS in these; not in what is good tc ?at, good to wear, good use of time, or what amount of land or of public aid each is entitled to claim .. This truth and justice men presently endeavor to make a.pplication of to the measuring of land, the apportionment of service, the protection of life and property. Their first endeavors, no doubt, are very awkward. Yet absolute right is the first gover- nor; or, every government is an impure theocracy. The idea after which each community is aiming to make and mend its law, is the will of the wise man. The wise man it cannot find in nature, and it makes awkward but earnest efforts to secure his govern- ment by contrivance; as by causing the entire people to give their voices on every measure; or by a double choice to get the representation of the whole; or by a selection of the best citizens; or to secure the advantages of efficiency and internal peace by confiding the government to one, who may himself select his agents. illl forms of government symbolize an immortal govern- ment, common to all dynasties and independent of numbers, perfect where two men exist, perfect where there is only OTle man.

Love and nature cannot maintain the assumption; it must be executed by a practical lie, namely by force. This undertaking for another is the blunder which stands in colossal ugliness in the governments of the world .. It is the same thing in numbers, as in a pair, only not quite so intelligible.

But if, without carrying him into the thought, I look over into his plot, and, guessing how it is vlith him, ordain this or that, he will never obey me.

A man who cannot be acquainted witl me, ta..~es me; looking from afar at me ordains that a part of my labor shall go to this or that whimsical end-not as I, but as he hap- pens to fancy. Behold the consequence. Of all debts men are least willing to pay the ta..\"l{es. \\\u00a5hat a satire is this on govern- ment! Everywhere they think they get their money's worth, except for these. Hence the less government we have the better-the fewer laws. and the less confided power. The antidote to this abuse of iormal governnlent is the influence of private character, the growth of the Individual; the appearance of the principal to supersede the proxy; the appearance of the wise man; of whom the existing government is, it must be owned, but a shabby imitation. That which all things tend to educe; which freedom, cultivation, inter- course, revolutions, go to form and deliver, is character; that is the end of Nature, to reach unto this coronation of her king. To educate the wjse man the State exists, and with the appearance of the wise man the State expires. The appearance of character makes the State unnecessary. The wise man is the State.

He needs no library, for he has not done thinking; no church, for he is a prophet; no statute-book, for he has the lawgiver; no money, for he is value; no road, for he is at home where he is; no experience, for the life of the creator shoots through him, and looks from his eyes.

In our barbarous society the influence of character is in its infancy. As a political power, as the rightful lord who is to tumble all rulers from their chairs, its presence is hardly yet suspected. Malthus and Ricardo quite omit it; the Annual Register is silent; in the Conversations' Lexicon it is not set down; the President's l\\1essage, the Queen's Speech, have not mentioned it; and yet it is never nothing. Every thought which genius and piety throw into the world, alters the world.

Every thought which genius and piety throw into the world, alters the world. The gladiators in the lists of power feel, through all their frocks of force and simulation, the presence of worth. I think. the very strife of trade and ambition is confession of this divinity; and successes in those fields are the poor amends, the fig-leaf with which the shamed soul attempts to hide its nakedness. I find the like unwilling homage in all quarters. It is because we know how much is due from us that we are impatient to show some petty talent as a substitute for worth. We are haunted by a con- science of this right to grandeur of character, and are false to it. But each of us has some talent, can do somewhat useful, or graceful, or formidable, or amusing, or lucrative. That we do, as an apology to others and to ourselves for not reaching the mark of a good and equal life .. But it does not satisfy us, whilst we thrust it on the notice of our companions. It may throw dust in their eyes, but does not smooth our own brow, or give us the tranquillity of the strong when we walk abroad. \\Ve do penance as we go.

Senators and presidents have climbed so high with pain enough, not because they think the place specially agree- able, but as an apology for real worth, and to vindicate their ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 433 manhood in our eyes. This conspicuous chair is their compensa\" tion to themselves for being of a poor, cold, hard nature. They must do what they can. Like one class of forest animals, they have nothing but a prehensile tail; climb they must, or crawl. If a man found himself so rich-natured that be could enter into strict relations with the best persons and make life serene around him by the dignity and sweetness of his behavior, could he afford to circumvent the favor of the caucus and the press, and covet relations so hollow and pompous as those of a politician? Surely nobody would be a .charlatan who could afford to be sincere. The tendencies of the times favor the idea of self-government,. and leave the individual, for all code, to the rewards and penalties of his own constitution; which work with more energy than we believe whilst we depend on artificial restraints. The movement in this direction has been very marked in modern history. ~Iuch has been blind and discreditable, but the nature of the revolu- tion is not affected by the vices of the revolters; for this is a purely moral force.

It was never adopted by any party in his- tory, neither can be. It separates the individual from all party, and unites him at the same time to the race. It promises a recognition of higher rights than those of personal freedom, or the security of property. A man has a right to be employed, to be trusted, to be loved, to be revered. The power of love, as the basis of a State, has never been tried. We must not imagine that all thIngs are lapsing into confusion if every tender protestant be not compelled to bear his part in certain social conventions; nor doubt that roads can be built, letters carried, and the fruit of labor secured, when the government of force is at an end. Are our methods now so excellent that all competition is hopeless? could not a nation of friends even devise better ways? On the other hand, let not the most conservative and timid fear anything from a premature surrender of the bayonet and the system of force. For, according to the order of nature, which is quite superior to our will, it stands thus; there will always be a gov- ernment of force where men are selfish; and when they are pure enough to abjure the code of torce they will be wise enough to see how these public ends of the post-office, of the highway, of 434 POLITICS commerce and the exchange of property, of museums and Ii .. braries, of institutions of art and science can be answered. \"Te live in a very 10\\\",l state of the world,", "will be wise enough to see how these public ends of the post-office, of the highway, of 434 POLITICS commerce and the exchange of property, of museums and Ii .. braries, of institutions of art and science can be answered. \"Te live in a very 10\\\",l state of the world, and pay unwilling tribute to governments founded on force. There is not, among the most religious and instructed men of the most religious and civil nations, a reliance on the moral sentiment and a sufficient belief in the unity of things, to persuade them that society can be maintained without artificial restraints, as well as the solar system; or that the private citizen might be reasonable and a good neighbor, without the hint of a jail or a confiscation. What is strange too, there never was in any man sufficient faith in the power of rectitude to inspire him with the broad design of reno- vating the State on the principle of right and love. All those who h3.ve pretended this design have been partial reformers, and have admitted in some manner the supremacy.of the bad State. I do not call to mind a single human being who has steadily denied the authority of the laws, on the simple ground of his own moral nature. Such designs, full of genius and full of faith as they are, are not entertained except avowedly as air-pictures. If the individual who exhibits them dare to think them practicable, he disgusts scholars and churchmen; and men of talent and women of superior sentiments cannot hide their contempt.

Could any man conduct into me the pure stream of that which he pretends to be! Long afterwards I find that quality elsewhere which he promised me. The genius of the Platunists is intoxicating to the student, yet how few particulars of it can I detach from all their books.

All persons exist to society by some shining trait of beauty or utility which they have. We borrow the pro- portions of the man from that one fine feature, and finish the portrait symmetrically; which is false, for the rest of his body is small or deformed. 1 observe a person who makes a good public appearance, and. conclude thence the perfection of his private character, on which this is based; but he has no private character. He is a graceful cloak or lay-figure for holidays. All our poets, heroes and saints, fail utterly in some one or in many parts to satisfy our idea, fail to draw our spontaneous interest, and so leave us without any hope of realization but in our own future.

Our native love of reality joins with this experience to teach us a little reserve, and to dissuade a too sudden surrender to the brilliant qualities of persons.

Let us go for universals; for the magnetism, not for the needles. Human life and its per. sons are poor empirical pretensions. A personal influence is at.L ignis fatuus. If they say it is great, it is great; if they say it is small, it is small; you see it, and you see it not, by turns; it borrows all its size from the momentary estimation of the speak- ers: the Wi1l-of-the-wisp vanishes if you go too near, vanishes if you go too far, and only blazes at one angle. 'Vno can tell if Washington be a great man or no? Who can tell if Franklin be? Yes, or any but the twelve, or six, or three great gods of fame? And they too loom and fade before the eternal. Weare amphibious creatures, weaponed for two elements, having two sets-of faculties, the particular and the catholic. We adjust our instrument for general observation, and sweep the heavens as easily as we pick out a single figure in the terrestrial landscape. We are practically skilful in detecting elements for which we have no place in our theory, and no name. Thus we are very sensible of an atmospheric influence in men and in bodies of men not accounted for in an arithmetical addition of all their , measurable properties.

England, strong, punctual, practical, well-spoken England I should not find if I should go to the island to seek it. In the parliament, in the play-house, at dinner-tables, I might see a great number of rich, ignorant, book-read, conventional, proud men-many old women-and not anywhere the English- man who made the good speeches, combined the accurate engines, and did the bold and nervous deeds. It is even worse in America, where, from the intellectual quickness of the race, the genius of the country is more splendid in its promise and more slight in its performance. Vv~ebster cannot do the work of Webster. We con- ceive distinctly enough the French, the Spanish, the German genius, and it is not the less real that perhaps we should not meet in either of those nations a single individual who corresponded with the type. 'lA' e infer the spirit of the nation in great measure from the language, which is a sort of monument to which each forcible individual in a course of many hundred years has con\u00b7 tributed a stone. And, universally, a good example of this social force is the veracity of language, which cannot be debauched. In any controversy concerning morals, an appeal may be made with safety to the sentiments which the language of the people expresses. Proverbs, words and grammar-inflections convey the public sense with more purity and precision than the wisest individual.

Our procli\\ity to details cannot quite degrade our life and divest it of poetry. The day-laborer is reckoned as standing at the foot of the social scale, yet he is saturated with the laws of the world. His measures are the hours; morning and night, solstice and equinox, geometry, astronomy and all the lovely accidents of nature play through his mind. Money, which repre- sents the prose of life, and which is hardly spoken of in parlors without an apology, is, in its effects and laws, as beautiful as roses.

Wherever you go, a wit like your own has been before you, and has realized its thought. The Eleusinian mysteries, the Egyptian architecture, the Indian astronomy, the Greek sculp- ture, show that there always were seeing and knowing men in the planet. The world is full of masonic ties, of guilds, of secret and public legions of honor; that of scholars, for example; and that of gentlemen, fraternizing with the upper class of every country and every culture. ' I am very much struck in literature by the appearance that OIle person wrote all the books; as if the editor of a journal planted his body of reporters in different parts of the field of action, and relieved some by others from time to time; but there is such equality and identity both of judgment and point of view in the narrative that it is plainly the work of one all-seeing, all- hearing gentleman. I looked into Pope's Odyssey yesterday: it is as correct and elegant after our canon of to-day as if it were newly written.

It is a greater joy to see the author's author, than himself. A higher pleasure of the same kind I found lately at a 440 NOM I N A LIS TAN D REA LIS T concert, where I went to bear Handel's l\\Iessiah. As the Inaster overpowered the littleness and incapableness of the performers and made them conductors of his electricity, so it was easy to observe what efforts nature was making, through so many hoarse, wooden and imperfect persons, to produce beautiful voices, fluid and soul-guided men and women. The genius of nature was para- mount at the oratorio. This preference of the genius to the parts is the secret of that deification of art, which is found in all sllperior minds. Art, in the artist, is proportion, or a habitual respect to the whole by an eye loving beauty in details. And the wonder and charm of it is the sanity in insanity which it denotes. Proportion is almost impossible to human beings. There is no one who does not ex- aggerate. In conversation, men are encumbered with personality, and talk too much. In modern sculpture, picture and poetry, the beauty is miscellaneous; the artist works here and there and at all points, adding and adding,", "Proportion is almost impossible to human beings.

In modern sculpture, picture and poetry, the beauty is miscellaneous; the artist works here and there and at all points, adding and adding, instead of unfolding the unit of his thought. Beautiful details we must have, or no artist; but . they must be means and never other. The eye must not lose sight for a moment of the purpose. Lively boys write to their ear and eye, and the cool reader finds nothing but sweet jingles in it. When they grow older, they respect the argument. We obey the same intellectual integrity when we study in exceptions the law of the world. Anomalous facts, as the never quite obsolete rumors of magic and demonology, and the new allegations of phrenologists and neurologists, are of ideal use. They are good indications. Homreopathy is insignificant as an art of healing, but of great value as criticism on the hygeia or medical practice of the time. So with l\\iesmerism, Swedenborgism, Fourierism, and the ::\\lillennial Church; they are poor preten- sions enough, but good criticism on the science, philosophy and preaching of the day. For these abnormal insights of the adepts ought to be normal, and things of course. All things show us that on every side we are very near to the best. It seems not worth while to execute with too much pains some one intellectual, or resthetical, or civil feat, when presently the dream will scatter, and we shall burst into universal power.

ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 441 The reason of idleness and of crime is the deferring of our hopes. Whilst we are waiting we beguile the time with jokes, with sleep, with eating and with crimes. Thus we settle it in our cool libraries, that all the agents with which we deal are subalterns, which we can well afford to let pass, and life will be simpler when w.e live at the centre and flout the surfaces. I wish to speak with all respect of persons, but some- times I must pinch myself to keep awake and preserve the due decorum. They melt so fast into each other that they are like grass and trees, and it needs an effort to treat them as individuals. Though the uninspired man certainly finds persons a conveniency in household nlatters, the divine man does not respect them; he sees them as a rack of clouds, or a fleet of ripples which the wind drives over the surface of the water. But this is fiat rebellion .. Nature will not be Buddhist: she resents generalizing, and insults the philosopher in every moment with a million of fresh particu\" lars. It is all idle talking: as much as a man is a whole, so is he also a part; and it were partial not to see it. ,\\7ha t you say in. your pompous distribution only distributes you into your clas!' and section.

If ,\\ve were not thus infatuated, if we saw the real from hour to hour, we should not be here to write and to read, but should have been burned or frozen long ago. She would never get anything done, if she suffered Admirable Crichtons and universal geniuses. She loves better a wheelwright who dreams all night of wheels, and a groom who is part of his horse; for she is full of work, and these are her hands. As the frugal farmer takes care that his cattle shall eat down the rowen, and swine shall cat the waste of his house, and poultry shall pick the crumbs -so our economical mother dispatches a new genius and habit of mind into every district and condition of existence, plants an eye wherever a new ray of light can fall, and gathering up into some man every property in the universe, establishes thousand- fold occult mutual attractions among her offspring, that alL this wash and waste of power may be imparted and exchanged. Great dangers undoubtedly accrue from this incarnation and distribution of the godhead, and hence Nature has her maligners, as if she were Circe; and Alphonso of Castile fancied he could have given useful advice. But she does not go unprovided; she has hellebore at the bottom of the cup. Solitude would ripen a plentiful crop of despots. The recluse thinks of men as having his manner, or as not having his manner; and as having degrees of it, more and less.

But when he comes into a public assembly he sees that men have very different manners from his own, and in their way admirable. In his childhood and youth he has had many checks and censures, and thinks modestly enough of his own endowment. \"~en afterwards he comes to unfold it in propitious circumstance, it seems the only talent; he is de- lighted with his success, and accounts himself alfeady the fellow of the great. But he goes into a mob, into a banking house, into a. mechanic's shop, into a mill, into a laboratory, into a ship, into a camp, and in each new place he is no better than an idiot; other talents take place, and rule the hour. The rotation which ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 443 whirls every leaf and pebble to the meridian, reac'.ues to every gift of man, and we all take turns at the top. For Nature, who abhors mannerism, has set her heart on breaking up all styles and tricks, and it is so much easier to do what one has done before than to do a new thing, that there is a perpetual tendency to a set mode. In every conversation, even the highest, there is a certain trick, which may be soon learned by an acute person, and then that particular style continued indefi- nitely. Each man too is a tyrant in tendency, because he would impose his idea on others; and their trick is their natural de- fence.

Hence the immense benefit of party in politics, as it reveals faults of character in a chief, which the intellectual force of the persons, with ordinary opportunity and not hurled into aphelion by hatred, could not have seen. Since we are all so stupid, what benefit that there should be two stupidities! It is like that brute advantage so essential to astronomy, of having the diameter of the earth's orbit for a base of its triangles. Democracy is morose, and runs to anarchy, but in the State and in the schools it is indispensable to resist the consolidation of all men into a few men. If John was perfect, why are you and I alive? As long as any man exists, there is some need of him; let him fight for his own. A new poet has appeared; a new char .. acter approached us; why should we refuse to eat bread until we have found his regiment and section in our old army-files? Why not a new man? Here is a new enterprise of Brook Farm! of Skeneateles, of Northampton: why so impatient to baptize them Essenes, or Port-Royalists, or Shakers, or by any known and effete name? Let it be a new way of living. '\\Vby have onlj two or three ways of life, and not thousands? Every man is wanted, and no man is wanted much. We came this time for condiments, not for corn.

We came this time for condiments, not for corn. We want the great genius only for joy; for one star more in our constellation, for one tree more in our grove. But he thinks we wish to belong to him, as he wishes to occupy us. He greatly mistakes us. I think I have done well if 1 444 NOMINALIST AND REALIST have acquired a new word from a good author; and my business \"\"ith him is to find my own, though it were only to melt him ..1own into an epithet or an image for daily use: \"Into paint will I grind thee, my briqe!\" To embroil the confusion and make it impossible to arrive at any general statement-when we have insisted on the imper- fection of individuals, our affections and our experience urge that e,\"ery individual is entitled to honor, and a very generous treatment is sure to be repaid. A recluse sees only two or three persons, and allows thenl all their room; they spread themselves at large. The statesman looks at many, and compares the few habitually with others, and these look less. Yet are they not entitled to this generosity of reception? and is not munificence the means of insight? For though gamesters say that the cards beat all the players, though they were never so skilful, yet in the contest we are now considering, the players are also the game, and share the power of the cards. If you criticise a fine genius, the odds are that you are out of your reckoning, and instead of the poet, are censuring your own caricature of him.

But care is taken that the whole tune shall be played. If we were not kept among surfaces, everything would be large and universal ~ now the excluded attributes burst in on us with the more brightness that they have been excluded. \"Your turn now, my tum next,\" is the rule of the game. The universality being hindered in its primary form, comes in the secondary form of all sides; the points come in succession to the meridian, and by the speed of rotation a new whole is formed. Nature keeps ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 44S herself whole ~nd her representation complete in the e~'Peri ... ence of each mInd. She suffers no seat to be vacant in her col- lege.

Whatever does not concern us is concealed from us .\u2022 ~ soon as a person is no longer related to our present well-being, he is concealed, or dies, as we say. Really, all things and per- sons are related to us, but according to our nature they act on us not at once but in succession, and we are made aware of their presence one at a time. All persons, all things which we have known, are here present, and many more than we see; the world is full. As the ancient said, the world is a plenum or solid; and if we sawall things that really surround us we should be imprisoned and unable to move. For though nothing is im- passable to the soul, but all things are pervious to it and like highways, yet this is only whilst the soul does not see them. As soon as the soul sees any object, it stops before that object. Therefore the divine Providence which keeps the universe open in every direction to the soul, conceals all the furniture and all the persons that do not concern a particular soul, from the senses of that individual. Through solidest eternal things the man finds his road as if they did not subsist, and does not once suspect their being. As soon as he needs a new object, suddenly he be- holds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it, but takes another way. When he has exhausted for the time the nourish- ment to be drawn from anyone person or thing, that object is withdrawn from his observation, and though still in his imme- diate neighborhood, he does", "be- holds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it, but takes another way.

Nothing is dead: men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out of the window, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise. Jesus is not dead; he is very well alive: nor John, nor Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at times we believe -we have seen them all and could easily tell the names under which they go. If we' cannot make voluntary and conscious steps in the ad- mirable science of universals, let us see the parts wisely, and infer the genius of nature from the best particulars with a be- 446 NOM I N A LIS TAN D REA LIS T coming charity. \\Vhat is best in each kind is an index of what should be the average of that thing. Love sho\\vs me the opulence of nature, by disclosing to me in my friend a hidden wealth, and I infer an equal depth of good in every other direction. It is commonly said by farmers that a good pear or apple costs no more time or pains to rear than a poor one; so I would have no work of art, no speech, or action, or thought, or friend, but the best.

No sen .. tence v,~ill hold the whole truth, and the only way in which we can be jusf, is by giving ourselves the lie; Speech is better than silence; silence is better than speech; All things are in contact; every atom has a spbere of repulsion; Things are, and are not, at the same time; and the like. All the universe over, there is but one thing, this old Two-Face, creator-creature, mind-matter, right-mong, of which any proposition may be affirmed or de .. nied. \\7ery fitly therefore I assert that every man is a partialist; that nature secures him as an instrun1ent by self-conceit, pre ..

His attention must be commanded by the signs that the Church, or religious party, is falling from the Church nomi- llal, and is appearing in temperance and non-resistance soci- etie,,; in movements of abolitionists and of socialists; and in very significant assemblies called Sabbath and Bible Conven .. tions; composed of ultraists, of seekers, of all the soul of the soldiery of dissent, and meeting to call in question the authority of the Sabbath, of the priesthood, and of the Church. In these movements nothing was more remarkable than the discontent they begot in the movers. The spirit of protest and of detach\u00b7\u00b7 ment drove the members of these Conventions to bear testimony against the Church, and immediately afterwards to declare their discontent with these Conventions, their independence of their. colleagues, and their impatience of the methods whereby they were working. They defied each other, like a congress of kings, each of whom had a realm to rule, and a way of his own that made concert unprofitable.

Others attacked the system of agriculture, the use of animal manures in farming, and the tyranny of man over brute nature; these abuses polluted his food.

No doubt there was plentiful vaporing, and cases of backsliding might occur .. But in each of these movements emerged a good result; a tendency to the adoption of simpler methods, and an assertion ,. ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 45 1 of the sufficiency of the private man. Thus it was directly in the spirit and genius of the age, what happened in one instance when a church censured and threatened to excommunicate one of its members on account of the somewhat hostile part to the church which his conscience led him to take in the anti-slavery business; the threatened individual immediately excommuni ... cated the church, in a public and formal process.

There was in all the practical activities of New England for the last quarter of a century, a gradual withdrawal of tender consciences from the social organizations. There is observable throughout, the contest bet,veen mechanical and spiritual meth, ods, but with a steady tendency of the thoughtful and virtuous to a deeper belief and reliance on spiritual facts. In politics, for example, it is easy to see the progress of dis- sent. The country is full of rebellion; the country is full of k.ings. Hands offt let there be no control and no interference in the administration of the affairs of this kingdom of me .. Hence the growth of the doctrine and of the party of Free Trade~ and the willingness to try that experiment, in the face of what appear incontestable facts.

The same disposition to scrutiny and dissent appeared in civil, festive, neighborly, and domestic society. A restless, pry- ing, conscientious criticism broke out in unexpected quarters. \\\\Tho gave me the money with which I bought my coat? Why should professional labor and that of the counting-house be paid so disproportionately to the labor of the porter and wood- saW\\:,er?

Am I not too protected a person? is there not a wide disparity between the lot of me and the lot of thee, my poor brother, my poor sister? .Am I not defrauded of my best culture in the loss of those gymnastics which manual labor and the emergencies of poverty constitute? I find nothing healthful or exalting in the smooth conventions of society; I do not like the close air of saloons. I begin to suspect myself to be a prisoner, though treated with all this courtesy and IQ~ury. I pay a destructive tax in my conformity. The same insatiable criticism may be traced in the efforts for the reform of Education. The popular education has been ta..\"ted with a want of truth and nature. It was complained that an education to things was not given. We are students of words: we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and recitation-rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, a memory of words, and do not know a thing. We cannot use our hands, or our legs, or our eyes, or our arms. We do not know an edible root in the woods, we cannot tell our course by the stars, nor the bour of the day by the sun. It is well if we ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 453 can swim and skate. We are afraid of a horse, of a cow, of a dog, of a snake, of a spider.

The old English rule was, 'All summer in the field, and all winter in the study.' And it seenlS as if a man should learn to plant, or to fish, or to hunt, that he might secure his subsistence at all events, and not be painful to his friends and fellow-men. The lessons of science should be experimental also. The sight of a planet through a telescope is worth all the course on astronomy; the shock of the electric spark in the elbow, outvalues all the theories; the taste of the nitrous oxide, the firing of an artificial volcano, are better than velumes of chemistry. One of the traits of the new spirit is the inquisition it fixed on our scholastic devotion to the dead languages .. The ancient languages, with great beauty of structure, contain wonderful remains of genius, which draw, and always will draw, certain like-minded men-Greek men, and Roman men-in all coun- tries, to their study; but by a wonderful drowsiness of usage they had exacted the study of all men. Once (say two centuries ago), Latin and Greek had a strict relation to all the science and culture there was in Europe, and the 3\\Iathematics had a momentary importance at some era of activity in physical sci- ence. These things became stereotyped as education, as the manner of men is. But the Good Spirit never cared for the colleges, and though all men and boys were now drilled in Latin, Greek and 1\\Iathematics, it had quite left these shells nigh and dry on the beach, and was now creating and feeding other matters at other ends of the world.

But in a hundred high schools and colleges this warfare against common .. sense still goes on. Four, or six, or ten years, the pupil is parsing Greek and Latin, and as soon as he leaves the University, as it is ludi- crously styled, he shuts those books for the last time. Some thousands of young men are graduated at our colleges in this country every year, and the persons who, at forty years, still read Greek, can all be counted on your hand. I never met with ten. Four or five persons I have seen who read Plato. But is not this absurd, that the whole liberal talent of this 454 N E 'v ENG LAN D REF 0 R MER S country should be directed in its best years on studies vlhich lead to nothing? '\\Vhat was the consequence? Some intelligent persons said or thought, 'Is that Greek and Latin some spell to conjure with, and not words of reason? If the physician, the lawyrer, the divine, never use it to come at their ends, I need never learn it to come at mine. Conjuring is gone out of fashion, and I will omit this conjugating, and go straight to affairs.! So they jumped the Greek and Latin, and read law, medicine, or sermons, without it. To the astonishment of all, the self-madE' men took even ground at once with the olde~t of the regular graduates, and in a few months the most conservative circles of Boston and New York had quite forgotten who of their gownsmen was", "and read law, medicine, or sermons, without it. To the astonishment of all, the self-madE' men took even ground at once with the olde~t of the regular graduates, and in a few months the most conservative circles of Boston and New York had quite forgotten who of their gownsmen was college-bred, and who was not. One tendency appears alike in the philosophical speculation and in the rudest democratical movements, through all the petu- lance and all the puerility, the wish, namely, to cast aside the superfluous and arrive at short methods; urged, as I suppose, by an intuition that the human spirit is equal to all emergencies, alone, and that man is more often injured than helped by the means he uses. I conceive this gradual casting off of material aid~ and the indication of growing trust in the private self-supplied powers of the individual, to be the affirmative principle of the recent philosophy, and that it is feeling its own profound truth and is reaching forward at this very hour to the happiest conclusions. I readily concede that in this, as in every period of intellectual activity, there has been a noise of denial and protest; much was to be resisted, much was to be got rid of by those who were reared in the old, before they couId begin to affirm and to construct. 1Iany a reformer perishes in his removal of rubbish; and that makes the offensiveness of the class. They are partial; they are not equal to the work they pretend.

It is of little moment that one or two or twenty errors of our social system be corrected, but of much that the man be in his senses. ESSAYS: SECOND SERIES 455 The criticism and attack on institutions, which we have wit- nessed, has made one thing plain, that society gains nothing whilst a man, not himself renovated, attempts to renovate things around him: he has become tediously good in some particular but negligent or narrow in the rest; and hypocrisy and vanity a:e often the disgusting result. It is handsomer to remain in the establishment better than the establishment, and conduct that in the best manner, than to make a sally against evil by some single improvement, with- out 3upporting it by a total regeneration. Do not be so vain of your one objection. Do you think there is only one? _o\\las! my good friend, there is no part of society or of life better than any other part. All our things are right and wrong together. The wave of evil washes all our institutions alike. Do vau com- . plain of our Marriage? Our marriage is no worse than our edu- cation, our diet, our trade, our social customs. Do you complain of the laws of Property? It is a pedantry to give such impor- tance to them.

Can we not play the game of life with these counters, as well as with those? in the institution of property, as well as out of it? Let into it the new and renewing principle of love, and property will be universality. No one gives the im- pressi9n of superiority to the institution, which he must give who will reform it. It makes no difference what you say, you must make me feel that you are aloof from it; by your natural and supernatural advantages do easily see to the end of it- do see how man can do without it. Now all men are on one side .. No man deserves to be heard against property_ Only Love, only an Idea, is against property as we hold it. I cannot afford to be irritable and captious, nor to waste all my tinle in attacks. If I should go out of church whenever I hear a false sentiment I could never stay there five minutes. But why come out? the street is as false as the church, and when I get to my house, or to my manners, or to my speech, I have not got away from the lie. When we see an eager assail- ant of one of these wrongs, a special reformer, we feel like asking him, What right have you, sir, to your one virtue? Is virtue piecemeal? This is a jewel amidst the rags of a beggar. 456 NEW ENG LAN D REF 0 R MER S In another way the right will be vindicated.

If partiality was one fault of the movement party, the other defect was their reliance on Association. Doubts such as those I have intimated drove many good persons to agitate the ques- tions of social reform. But the revolt against the spirit of com- merce, the spirit of aristocracy, and the inveterate abuses of cities, did not appear possible to individuals; and to do battle against numbers they armed themselves with numbers, and against concert they relied on new concert. Following or advancing beyond the ideas of St. Simon, of Fourier, and of Owen, three communities have already been formed in 11assachusetts on kindred plans, and many more in the country at large. They aim to give every member a share in the manual labor, to give an equal reward to labor and to talent. and to unite a liberal culture with an education to labor . . The scheme offers, by the economies of associated labor and expense, to make every member rich, on the same amount of property that, in separate families, would leave every member poor. These new associations are composed of men and women of superior talents and sentiments; yet it may easily be questioned whether such a community will draw, except in its beginnings, the able and the", "rich, on the same amount of property that, in separate families, would leave every member poor. These new associations are composed of men and women of superior talents and sentiments; yet it may easily be questioned whether such a community will draw, except in its beginnings, the able and the good; whether those who have energy will not prefer their chance of superiority and power in the world, to the humble certainties of the association; whether such a retreat does not promise to become an asylum to those who have tried and failed, rather than a field to the strong; and whether the members will not necessarily be fractions of men, because each finds that he cannot enter it without some compromise. Friend- ship and association are very fine things, and a grand phalanx of the best of the human race, banded for some catholic object; yes. e.1:cellent; but remember that no society can ever be so large ESSAYS: SECO~D SERIES .4~7 .;) as one man. He, in his friendship, in his natural and momentary associations!, doubles or mUltiplies himself; but in the hour in which he mortgages himself to two or ten or twenty, be dwarfs himself bela,,'\" the stature of one. But the men of less faith could not thus believe, and to such, concert appears the sole specific of strength. I have failed, and you have failed, but perhaps together we shall not fail.

I have not been able either to persuade my brother or to preyail on myself to disuse the traffic or the potation of brandy, but per- haps a pledge of total abstinence might effectually restrain us. The candidate my party votes for is not to be trusted with a dollar, but he will be honest in the Senate, for we can bring public opinion to bear on him. Thus concert was the specific in all cases. But concert is neither better nor worse, neither more nor less potent, than individual force. All the men in the world cannot make a statue walk and speak, cannot make a drop of blood, or a blade of grass, any more than one man can. But let there be one man, let there be truth in two men, in ten men, then is concert for the first time p0ssible; because the force ,,~bich moves the world is a new quality, and can never be furnished by adding whatever quantities of a different killd. '\\~at is the use of the concert of the false and the disunited? There can be no concert in two, where there is no concert in one. ,,7hen the individual is not individual, but is dual; when his thoughts look one way and his actions another; when his faith is traversed by his habits; when his will, enlightened by reason, is warped by his sense; when with one hand he rows and with the other backs water, what concert can be?

But this union must be inward, and not one of covenants, and is to be reached by a reverse of the methods they use. The union is only perfect when all the uniters are isolated. It is the union of friends who live in different streets or towns. Each man, if he attempts to join himself to others, is on all sides cramped and diminished of his proportion; and the stricter the union the smaller and the more pitiful he is. But leave him alone, to recognize in every hour and place the secret soul; he will go up and down doing the works of a true member, and, to the astonishment of all, the work will be done with concert, though no man spoke.

I pass to the indication in some particulars of that faith in man, which the heart is preaching to us in these days, and which ~ngages the more regard, from the consideration that the specula- tions of one generation are the history of the next following. In alluding just now to our system of education, I spoke of the deadness of its details. But it is open to graver criticism than the palsy of its members: it is a system of despair. The disease with which the human mind now labors is want of faith. l\\1en do not believe in a power of education. \\Ve do not think we can speak to divine sentiments in man, and we do not try.

A lnan of good sense but of little faith, whose compassion seemed to lead him to church as often as he went there, said to me that \"he liked to have concerts, and fairs, and churches, and other public amusements go on.\" I am afraid the remark is too honest: and comes from the same origin as the maxim of the tyrant, \"If you would rule the world quietly, you must keep it amused.~) I notice too that the ground on which eminent pub- lic servants urge the claims of popular education is fear; 'This \\~untry is filling up with thousands and millions of voters, and ESSAYS: SECO~D SERIES 459 you must educate them to keep them from our throats.' \\''-e do not believe that any education,", "that the ground on which eminent pub- lic servants urge the claims of popular education is fear; 'This \\~untry is filling up with thousands and millions of voters, and ESSAYS: SECO~D SERIES 459 you must educate them to keep them from our throats.' \\''-e do not believe that any education, any system of phi1osophy~ any influence of genius, will ever giYe depth of insight to a super- ficial mind.

It appears that some doubt is felt by good and wise men whether really the happiness and probity of men is increased by the culture of the mind in those disciplines to which we give the name of education .. Unhappily too the doubt comes from scholars, from persons who have tried these methods. In their experience the scholar was not raised by the sacred thoughts amongst which he dwelt, but used them to selfish ends. He was a profane per- son, and became a showman, turning his gifts to a marketable use, and not to his own sustenance and growth.

You remember the story of the poor woman who importuned King Philip of Macedon to grant her justice, which Philip refused: the woman exclaimed, \"I appeal:\" the king, astonished, asked to whom she appealed: the woman re- plied, \"From Philip drunk to Philip sober.\" The text will suit me very well.

I believe not in two classes of men, but in man in two moods, in Philip drunk and Philip sober. I think, accord- ing to the good-hearted word of Plato, HUnwillingly the soul is deprived of truth.\" Iron conservative, miser, or thief, no man is but by a supposed necessity which he tolerates by shortness ~r torpidity of sight. The soul lets no man go without some visitations and holidays of a diviner presence. It would be easy to show, by a narrow scanning of any man's biography, that we are not so wedded to our paltry performances of every kind but that every man has at intervals the grace to scorn his perform\"\" ances, in comparing them with his belief of what he should do; that he puts himself on the side of his enemies, listening gladly to what they say of him, and accusing hhnself of the same things. \\Vbat is it men love in Genius, but its infinite hope, which degrades all it has done? Genius counts all its miracles poor and short. Its own idea is never executed.

His broad humanity transcends all sectional lines .. This range of Plato instructs us what to think of the vexed question concerning his reputed works-what are genuine, what spurious. It is singular that wherever we find a man higher by a whole head than any of his contemporaries, it is sure to come into doubt what are his real works. Thus Homer, Plato, Raffaelle, Shakspeare. For these men magnetize their contemporaries, so that their companions can do for them what they can never do for themselves; and the great man does thus live in several bodies, and write, or paint or act, by many hands; and after some time it is not easy to say what is the authentic work of the mas .. ter and what is only of his school. Plato, too, like every great man, consumed his own times. ,'Vhat is a great man but one of great affinities, who takes up into himself all arts, sciences, all knowables, as his food? He can spare nothing; he can dispose of every thing. \\Vhat is not good for virtue, is good for knowledge. Hence his contemporaries tax him with plagiarism. But the inventor only knows how to borrow; and society is glad to forget the innumerable laborers who min- istered to this architect, and reserves all its gratitude for him. \"~en we are praising Plato, it seems we are praising quotations from Solon and Sophron and Philolaus.

And this grasping inventor puts all nations under contribution.

He says, in the Republic, ~\"Such a genius as philosophers nlust of necessity have, is wont but seldom in all its parts to meet in one man:- but its different parts generally spring up in different persons.\" Every man who would do anything ,,\"ell, must come to it from a higher ground . .J.~ philosopher must be more than a philosopher. Plato is clothed with the powers of a poet, stands upon the highest place of the poet, and (though I doubt he wanted the decisive gift of lyric eA-pression) , nlainly is not a poet because be chose to use the poetic gift to an ulterior purpose.

As a good chimney burns its smoke, so a philosopber converts the value of all his fortunes into his intellectual performances. He was born 427 B. c., about the time of the death of Pericles; was of patrician connection in his times and city, and is said to have had an early inclination for war, but, in his twentieth year 1 meeting with Socrates, was easily dissuaded from this pursuit and remained for ten years his scholar, until the death of Socrates. He then went to l\\iegara, accepted the invitations of Dian and of Dionysius to the court of Sicily, and went thither three times:\" though very. capriciously treated. He travelled into Italy; then into Egy'\"Pt, where he stayed a long time; some say three-some say thirteen years. It is said he went farther, into Babylonia: this is uncertain. Returning to Athens, he gave lessons in th~ Academy to those whom his fame drew thither ~ and died, as we have received it, in the act of writing, at eighty-one years. But the biography of Plato is interior. We are to account for 474 PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER the supreme elevation of this man in the intellectual history of our race-how it happens that in proportion to the culture of men they become his scholars; that, as our Jewish Bible has implanted itself in the table-talk", "is interior.

He stands between the truth and every man's mind, and has almost im- pressed language and the primary forms of thought with his name and seal. I am struck, in reading him, with the extreme modern- ness of his style and spirit. Here is the germ of that Europe we know so well, in its long history of arts and arms; here are all its traits, already discernible in the mind of Plato-and in none before him. It bas spread itself since into a hundred histories, but has added no new element. This perpetual nl~dernness is the measure of merit in every work of art; since the author of it was not misled by any thing short-lived or local, but abode by real and abiding traits. How Plato came th.us to be Europe, and philosophy, and almost literature, is the problem to solve. This could not have happened without a sound, sincere and catholic man, able to honor, at the same time, the ideal, or laws of the mind, and fate, or the order of nature. The first period of a natIon, as of an individual, is the period of unconscious strength. Children cry, scream and stamp with fury, unable to express their desires.

In adult life, whilst the perceptions are obtuse, men and women talk ve- hementlyand superlatively, blunder and quarrel: their manners are full of desperation; their speech is full of oaths. As soon as, with culture, things have cleared up a little, and they see them no longer in lumps and masses but accurately distributed, they desist from that weak vehemence and e:\\1J1ain their meaning in detail.

That is the mo- \"' ment of adult health, the culmination of power. Such is the history of Europe, in all points; and such in philos .. ophy. Its early records, almost perished, are of the immigra- tions from Asia, bringing with them the dreams of barbarians; a confusion of crude notions of morals and of natural philosophy, gradually subsiding through the partial insight of single teachers. Before Pericles came the Seven 'Vise 1\\fasters, and we have the beginnings of geometry, metaphysics and ethics: then the partial- ists-deducing the origin of things from flux or water~ or from air, or from fire: or from mind ..

Philosophy is the account which the human mind gives to itself of the constitution of the world. Two cardinal facts lie forever at the base; the one, and the two. I.

All philosophy, of East and vVest, has the same centripetence. Urged by an opposite necessity, the mind returns from the one to that which is not one, but other or many; from cause to effect; and affirms the neces- sary existence of variety, the self-existence of both, as each is involved in the other. These strictly-blended elements it is the problem of thought to separate and to reconcile. Their existence is mutually contradictory and exclusive; and each so fast slides into the other that we can never say what is one, and what it is not. The Proteus is as nimble in the highest as in the lowest grounds; when we contemplate the one, the true, the good- as in the surfaces and extremities of matter. In all nations there are minds which", "that we can never say what is one, and what it is not.

In all nations there are minds which incline to dwell in the ~onception of the fundamental Unity. The raptures of prayer and ecstasy of devotion lose all being in one Being. This tendency finds its highest eAlJression in the religious writings of the East, and chiefly in the Indian Scriptures, in the Vedas, the Bhagavat Geeta, and the Vishnu Purana. Those writings contain little else than this idea, and they rise to pure and sublime strains in cele- brating it. The Same, the Same: friend and foe are of one stuff; the ploughman, the plough and the furrow are of one stuff; and the stuff is such and so much that the variations of form are unim- portant. \"You are fit\" (says the supreme Krishna to a sage) \"to apprehend that you are not distinct from me.

As one diffusive air, passing through the perforations of a flute, is distinguished as the notes of a scale, so the nature of the Great Spirit is single, though its forms be manifold, arising from the consequences of acts. \\Yhen the difference of the investing form, as that of god or the rest, is destroyed, there is no distinction.\" '''The whole world is but a manifestation of \\ \"'ishnu, who is identical with all things, and is to be regarded by the wise as not differing from, but as the same as themselves.

That whicb the soul seeks is resolution into being above form, out of Tar'\" tarus and out of heaven-liberation from nature.

By religion, he tends to unity; by intellect, or by the senses, to the many. A too rapid unification, and an excessive appliance to parts and par- ticulars, are the twin dangers of speculation. To this partiality the history of nations corresponded. The country of unity, of immovable institutions, the seat of a philoso- phy delighting in abstractions, of men faithful in doctrine and in pra~tice to the idea of a deaf, unimplorable, immense fate, is Asia; and it realizes this faith in the social institution of caste.

On the other side, the genius of Europe is active and creative: it resists caste by culture; its philosophy was a discipline; it is a land of arts, inventions, trade, freedom. If the East loved infin .. ity, the West delighted in boundaries. European civility is the triumph of talent, the extension of system, the sharpened understanding, adaptive skill, delight in forms, delight in manifestation, in comprehensible results. Pericles, Athens, Greece, had been working in this element with the joy of genius not yet chilled by any foresight of the detri- ment of an e..~cess. They saw before them no sinister political economy; no ominous !\\.1althus; no Paris or London; no pitiless subdivision of classes-the doom of the pin-makers, the doom of the weavers, of dressers, of stockingers, of carders, of spin- ners, of colliers; no Ireland ~ no Indian caste, superinduced by the efforts of Europe to throw it off. The understanding was in its health and prime. Art was in its splendid novelty. They cut the Pentelican marble as if it were snow, and their perfect works in architecture and sculpture seemed things of course, not more difficult than the completion of a new ship at the Medford yards, or new mills at Lowell. These things are in course, and may be taken for granted.

The unity of Asia and the detail of Europe; the infinitude of PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER 47g the ... \"'-siatic soul and the defining, result-loving~ machine-making, surface-seeking, opera-going Europe-Plato came to join~ and, by contact, to enhance the energy of each. The excellence of Europe and .A.sia are in his brain. 2\\Ietaphysics and natural philosophy expressed the genius of Europe; he substructs the religion of .A.sia, as the base. In short, a balanced soul was born, perceptive of the two elements. It is as easy to be great as to be small. The reason why we do not at once believe in admirable souls is because thev are .. not in our experience. In actual life, they are so rare as to be incredible; but primarily there is not only no presumption against them, but the strongest presumption in favor of their appearance. But whether voices were heard in the sky, or not; whether his mother or his father dreamed that the infant man-child was the son of Apollo; whether a swarm of bees settled on his lips, or not-a man who could see two sides of a thing was born. The wonderful synthesis so familiar in nature; the upper and the under side of the medal of Jove; the union of impossibilities, which reappears in every object; its real and it..) ideal power -was now also transferred entire to the consciousness of a man.

The balanced soul came. If he loved abstract truth, he saved himself by propounding the most popular of all principles, the absolute good, which rules rulers, and judges the judge. If he made transcendental distinctions, he fortified himself by draw- ing all his illustrations from sources disdained by orators and polite conversers; from mares and puppies; from pitchers and soup-ladles; from cooks and criers; the shops of potters, horse- doctors, butchers and fishmongers. He cannot forgive in himself a partiality, but is resolved tba t the two poles of thought shall appear in his statement. His argument and his sentence are self ... poised and spherical.. The two poles appear; yes, and become two hands, to grasp and appropriate their own. Every great artist has been such by synthesis. Our strength is transitional, alternating; or, shall I say, a thread of two strands~ The sea-shore, sea seen from shore, shore seen from sea; the taste of two metals in contact; and our enlarged powers at thG approach and at the departnre of a friend; the experience of 480 P L A TO; 0 R, THE PHI:L 0 SOP HER poetic creativeness, which is not found in staying at home, nor yet in travelling, but in transitions from one to the other, which must therefore be adroitly managed to present as much transi. tional surface as possible; this command of two elements must explain the power and the charm of Plato.

Art expresses the one or the same by the different. Thought seeks to know unity in unity; poetry to show it by variety; that is, always by an sbject or symbol. Plato keeps the two vases, one of rether and one of pigment, at his side, and invariably uses both. Things added to things, as statistics, civil history, are inventories. Things used as language are inexhaustibly attractive. Plato turns inces- santly the obverse and the reverse of the medal of Jove .. To take an example: The physical philosophers had sketched each his theory of the world; the theory of atoms, of fire, of flux, of spirit; theories mechanical and chemical in their genius. Plato, a master of mathematics, studious of all natural laws and causes, feels these, as second causes, to be no theories of the world but bare inventories and lists. To the study of nature he therefore prefixes the dogma-\"Let us declare the cause which led the Supreme Ordainer to produce and compose the universe .. He was good; and he who is good has no kind of envy. Exempt from envy, he 'Wished that all things should be as much as pos- sible like himself. \\V'hosoever, taught by wise men, shall admit this as the prime cause of the origin and foundation of the world, will be in the truth.\" \"All things are for the sake of the good, and it is the cause of every thing beautiful.\" This dogma animates and impersonates his philosophy_ The synthesis which makes the character of his mind appears in all his talents .. \"\"'here there is great compass of wit, we usually find excellencies that", "are for the sake of the good, and it is the cause of every thing beautiful.\" This dogma animates and impersonates his philosophy_ The synthesis which makes the character of his mind appears in all his talents .. \"\"'here there is great compass of wit, we usually find excellencies that combine easily in the living man, but in description appear incompatible. The mind of Plato is not to be exhibited by a Chinese catalogue, but is to be apprehended by an original mind in the exercise of its original power. In him the freest abandonment is united with the precision of a geometer. His daring imaginaton gives him the more solid grasp of facts; as the birds of highest flight have the strongest alar bones. His patrician polish, his intrinsic elegance, edged by an P L A TO; 0 R, THE PHI LOS 0 P HER 48] irony so subtle that it stings and paralyzes, adorn the soundest health and strength of frame. .~ccording to the old sentence j \"If Jove should descend to the earth, he would speak. in the style of Plato.~' \\\\\"Pith this palatial air there is~ for the direct aim oi several of his works and running through the tenor of them ali, a certain earnestness, which mounts, in the Republic and in the Ph~do, to piety. He has been charged with feigning sickness at the time of the death of Socrates. But the anecdotes that have come dovm from the times attest his manly interference before the people in his master's behalf, since even the savage cry of the assembly to Plato is preserved ~ and the indignation towards popular government, in ulany of his pieces, expresses a personal exaspera- tion.

He has a probity, a native reverence for justice and honor, and a humanity ,,\"hich makes him tender for the superstitions of the people. ...~dd to this, he believes that poetry, prophecy and the high insight are from a wisdom of which man is not master; that the gods never philosophize, but by a celestial mania these miracles are accomplished. Horsed on these winged steeds, he s,,~eeps the dim regions, visits worlds which flesh cannot enter: be saw the souls in pain, he hears the doom of the judge, he beholds the penal metempsychosis, the Fates, with the rock and shears, and hears the intoxicating hum of their spindle. But his circumspection never forsook him. One would say he h.a~ read the inscription on the gates of Busyrane--\"Be bold; n and on the second gate-'~Be bold, be bold, and everymore be bold;\" and then again had paused well at the third gate-4~Be not too bold.\" His strength is like the momentum of a falling planet, and his discretion the return of its due and perfect curve -so excellent is his Greek love of boundary and his skill in definition. In reading logarithms one is not more secure than in following Plato in his flights. Nothing can be colder than his head, when the lightnings of his imagination are playing in the sky. He has finished his thinking before he brings it to the reader, and he abounds in the surprises of a literary mastel ..

There is indeed no weapon in all the armory of wit \\yhich he did not possess and use-epic, analysis, mania, intuition, music, satire and irony, down to the customary and polite. His illustrations are poetry and his jests illustrations. Socrates' profession of obstetric art is good philosophy; and his finding that word \"cookery,\" and '~adulatory art,\" for rhetoric, in the Gorgias, does us as a substantial service still. No orator ~ measure in effect with him who can give good nicknames. \\\\That moderation and understatement and checking his thun- der in mid volley! He has good~naturedly furnished the courtier and citizen with all that can be said against the schools. \"For philosophy is an elegant thing, if anyone modestly meddles with it; but if he is conversant with it more than is becoming, it corrupts the man.\" He could well afford to be generous-he, who from the sunlike centrality and reach of his vision, had a faith without cloud ..

Such as his perception, was his speech: he plays with the doubt and makes the most of it: he paints and quibbles; and by and by comes a sentence that moves the sea and land. The admirable earnest comes not only at intervals, in the perfect yes and no of the dialogue, but in bursts of light. ((I, therefore, Callicles, am persuaded by these accounts, and consider how I may exhibit my soul before the judge in a healthy condition. 'Vberefore, disregarding the honors that most men value, and looking to the truth, I shall endeavor in reality to live as virtuously as I can; and when I die, to die so. And I invite all other men, to the utmost of my power; and you too I in tum invite to this contest, which, I affirm, surpasses all con ... tests here.\" He is a great average man; one who, to the best thinking, adds a proportion and equality in his faculties, so that men see in him their own dreams and glimpses made available and made to pass for what they are. A great common-sense is his war- rant and qualification to be the world's interpreter. He has rea ...

He omits never this graduation, but slopes his thought~ however picturesque the precipice on one side, to an access from the plain. He never writes in ecstasy, or catches us up into poetic raptures. Plato apprehended the cardinal facts.

He even stood ready, as in the Parmenides, to demonstrate that it was so-that this Being exceeded the limits of intellect.. No man ever more fully acknowledged the Ineffable. Having paid his homage, as for the human race, to the Illimitable, he then stood erect, and for the human race affirmed, 'And yet things are knowable!

It rests on the observation of identity and diversity; for to judge is to unite to an object the notion which belongs to it .. The sciences, even the best-mathematics and astronomy-are like sportsmen, who seize whatever prey offers, even without being able to make any use of it. Dialectic must teach the use of them. \"This is of that rank. that no intellectual man will enter on any study for its own sake, but only with a view to advance himself in that one sole science which embraces all..\" 484 P L A TO; 0 R, I H E PHI LOS 0 P HER \"The essence or peculiarity of man is to comprehend a whole; or that which in the diversity of sensatiQns can be comprised under a rational unity.\" \"The soul which has never perceived the truth, cannot pass into the human form.\" I announce to men the Intellect.

The misery of man is to be baulked of the sight of essence and to be stuffed with conjectures; but the supreme good is reality; the supreme beauty is reality; and all virtue and all felicity depend on this science of the real: for courage is nothing else than knowledge; the fairest fortune that can befall man is to be guided by his dremon to that which is truly his own. This also is the essence of justice-to attend every one bis own: nay, the notion of virtue is not to be arrived at except through direct contemplation of the divine essence. Courage then! for \"the persuasion that we must search that which we do not know, will render us, beyond comparison, bet- ter, braver and more industrious than if we thought it impos- sible t() discover what we do not know, and useless to search for it.\" He secures a position not to be commanded, by his passion for reality; valuing philosopby only as it is the pleasure of con- versing with real being. Thus, full of the genius of Europe, he said, Culture. He saw the institutions of Sparta and recognized, more genially one would say than any since, the hope of education. He delighted in every accomplishment, in every graceful and useful and truth ... ful performance; above all in the splendors of genius and intel .. lectual achievement. \"The whole of life, 0 Socrates,\" said Glauco, \"is, with the wise, the measure of hearing such dis- courses as these.:\" ''-'''bat a price he sets on the feats of talent, on the powers of Pericles, of Isocrates, of Parmenidesl What", "the splendors of genius and intel .. lectual achievement. \"The whole of life, 0 Socrates,\" said Glauco, \"is, with the wise, the measure of hearing such dis- courses as these.:\" ''-'''bat a price he sets on the feats of talent, on the powers of Pericles, of Isocrates, of Parmenidesl What price above price on the talents themselves! He called the several faculties, gods, in his beautiful personation. What value he gives PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER 485 to the art of gymnastic in education: what to geometry: what to music; what to astronomy~ whose appeasing and medicinal power he celebrates! In the Timreus he indicates the highest employ- ment of the eves. '~By us it is asserted that God invented and .. - bestowed sight on us for this purpose-that on surveying the circles of intelligence in the heavens, we might properly employ those of our own minds, which. though disturbed when compared with the others that are uniform, are still allied to their circula- tions: and that having thus learned, and being naturally pos- sessed of a correct reasoning faculty, we might, by imitating the uniform revolutions of divinity, set right our own wanderings and blunders.\" .And in the Republic-\"By each of these disci- plines a certain organ of the soul is both purified and reanimated which is blinded and buried by studies of another kind ~ an organ better worth saving than ten thousand eyes, since truth is per\u00b7 ceived by this alone.\" He said, Culture; but he first admitted its basis, and gave immeasurably the first place to advantages of nature. His pa- trician tastes laid stress on the distinctions of birth. In the doc- trine of the organic character and disposition is the origin of caste. \"Such as were fit to govern, into their composition the infonning", "admitted its basis, and gave immeasurably the first place to advantages of nature. His pa- trician tastes laid stress on the distinctions of birth. In the doc- trine of the organic character and disposition is the origin of caste. \"Such as were fit to govern, into their composition the infonning Deity mingled gold; into the military, silver: iron and brass for husbandmen and artificers.\" The East confirms itself, in all ages, in this faith. The Koran is explicit on this point of caste. '\"J\\Ien have their metal, as of gold and silver. Those of you who were the worthy ones in the state of ignorance, will be the worthy ones in the state of faith, as soon as you embrace it.\" Plato was not less firm. \"Of the five orders of things, only four can be taught to the generality of men.\" In the Repub- lic he insists on the temperaments of the youth, as first of the first .. A happier example of the stress laid on nature is in the dia- logue with the young Theages, who wishes to receive lessons from Socrates. Socrates declares that if some have grown wise by associating with him, no thanks are due to him: but, simply, whilst they were with him they grew wise, not because of him; he pretends not to know the way of it. \"It is adverse to many, 486 P L A TO; 0 R, THE PHI LOS 0 P HER nor can those be benefited by associating with me whom the Dremon opposes; so that it is not possible for me to live with these. \\\\rith many however he does not prevent me from convers .. ing, who yet are not at all benefited by associating with me.

Such, 0 Theages, is the association with me; for, if it pleases the God, you will make great and rapid proficiency: you will not, if he does not please. Judge whether it is not safer to be instructed by some one of those who have power over the bene- fit which they impart to men, than by me, who benefit or not, just as It may happen.\" As if he had said, 'I have no system. I cannot be answerable for you. You will be what you must. If there is love between us, inconceivably delicious and profitable will our iBterCQUrse be; if not, your time is lost and you will only annoy me. I shall seem to you stupid, and the reputation I have, false. Quite above us, beyond the will of you or me, is this secret affinity or repulsion laid. All my good is magnetic, and I edu .. cate, not by lessons, but by going about my business.' He said, Culture; he said, Nature; and he failed not to add, 'There is also the divine.' There is no thought in any mind but it quickly tends to convert itself into a power and organizes a huge instrumentality of means. Plato, lover of limits, loved the illimitable, saw the enlargement and nobility which come from truth itself and good itself, and attempted as if on the part of the human intellect, once for all to do it adequate homage- homage fit for the immense soul to receive, and yet homage becoming the intellect to render.", "the illimitable, saw the enlargement and nobility which come from truth itself and good itself, and attempted as if on the part of the human intellect, once for all to do it adequate homage- homage fit for the immense soul to receive, and yet homage becoming the intellect to render. He said then, 'Our faculties run out into infinity, and return to us thence. We can define but a little way; but here is a fact which will not be skipped, and which to shut our eyes upon is suicide. All things are in a scale; and, begin where we will, ascend and ascend. All things are sym .. bolical; and what we call results are beginnings.' A key to the method and completeness of Plato is his twice bisected line. After he has illustrated the relation between the absolute good and true and the forms of the intelligible world\" he says: \"Let there be a line cut in two unequal parts. Cut again each of these two main parts-one representing the visible, the other the intelligible world-and let these two new sections repre- P LA TO; 0 R, THE PHI LOS 0 P HER 487 sent the bright part and the dark part of each of these worlds. 1'\" ou will have, for one of the sections of the ,~isible world, images, that is, both shadov,-s and reflections-for the other section, the objects of these images, that is, plants~ animals, and the works of art and nature.

The universe is perforated by a minion channels for his activity. All things mount and mount. All his thought has this ascension; in Phredrus. teaching that beauty is the most lovely of all things, exciting hilarity and shed\u00b7, ding desire and confidence through the universe wherever it enters, and it enters in some degree into all things-but that there is another, which is as much more beautiful than beauty as beauty is than chaos~ namely, wisdom, which our wonderful organ of sight cannot reach unto, but which, could it be seen, would ravish us with its perfect reality. He has the same regard to it as the source of excellence in works of art. 'V'hen an artificer . \u2022 he says, in the fabrication of any work, looks to that which always subsists according to tlte sa1JZe; and, employing a model of this kind, expresses its idea and po,,\"'er in his work-it must follow that his production should be beautiful. But when be beholds that which is born and dies, it will be far from beautiful. Thus ever: the Banquet is a teaching in the same spirit, familiar now to all the poetry and to all the sermons of the world, that the love of the sexes is initial, and symbolizes at a distance the passion of the soul for that immense lake of beauty it exists to seek. This faith in the Divinity is never out of", "now to all the poetry and to all the sermons of the world, that the love of the sexes is initial, and symbolizes at a distance the passion of the soul for that immense lake of beauty it exists to seek. This faith in the Divinity is never out of minsl, and constitutes the ground of all his dogmas. Body cannot teach wisdom-God only. In the same mind he constantly affirms that . ~ virtue cannot be taught~ that it is not a science, but an inspira- tion~ that the greatest goods are produced to us through mania and are assigned to us by a divine gift. This leads me to that central figure whieh h~ has established 488 P L A TO; 0 R, THE PHI LOS 0 P HER in his Academy as the organ through which every considered opinion shall be announced, and whose biography he has likewise so labored that the historic facts are lost in the light of Plato's mind. Socrates and Plato are the double star which the most powerful instruments will not entirely separate. Socrates again, in his traits and genius, is the best example of that synthesis which constitutes Plato's extraordinary power. Socrates, a man of humble stem, but honest enough; of the commonest history; of a personal homeliness so remarkable as to be a cause of wit in others-the rather that his broad good nature and exquisite taste for a joke invited the sally, which was sure to be paid. The players personated him on the stage; the potters copied his ugly face on their stone jugs. He was a cool fellow, adding to his humor a perfect temper and a knowledge of his man, be he who he might whom he talked with, which laid the companion open to certain", "players personated him on the stage; the potters copied his ugly face on their stone jugs. He was a cool fellow, adding to his humor a perfect temper and a knowledge of his man, be he who he might whom he talked with, which laid the companion open to certain defeat in any debate-and in debate he im- moderately delighted. The young men are prodigiously fond of him and invite him to their feasts, whither he goes for conver .. sation. He can drink, too; has the strongest head in Athens; and after leaving the whole party under the table, goes away as if nothing had happened J to begin new dialogues with somebody that is sober .. In short, he was what our countrypeople call an ()ld one. He affected a good many citizen-like tastes, was monstrously fond of Athens, hated trees, never willingly went beyond the walls, knew the old characters, valued the bores and philistines, thought every thing in Athens a little better than anything in my other place. He was plain as a Quaker in habit and speech, affected low phrases, and illustrations from cocks and quails, soup-pans and sycamore-spoons, grooms and farriers, and un- namable offices-especially if he talked with any superfine per- son.

The rare coincidence, in one ugly body, of the droll and the lnartyr, the keen street and market debater with the sweetest saint known to any history at that tinle, had forcibly struck the mind of Plato, so capacious of these contrasts; and the figure of Socrates by a necessity placed itself in the foreground of the scene, as the fittest dispenser of the intellectual treasures he had to communicate. It was a rare fortune that this Aesop of the mob and this robed scholar should meet, to make each other immortal in their mutual faculty.

There is an interval; and to cohesion, contact is necessary. I knoW' not what can be said in reply to this criticism but that we have come to a fact in the nature of things: an oak is not an orange. The qualities of sugar remain with sugar, and those of salt with salt. In the second place, he has not a system. The dearest defenders and disciples are at fault.

He has clapped copyright on the world. This is the ambition of individualism. But the mouthful proves too large. Boa con- strictor has good will to eat it, but he is foiled.

There he perishes: unconquered nature lives on and forgets him. So it fares with all: so must it fare with Plato. In view of eternal nature, Plato turns out to be philosophical exercitations. He argues on this side and on that. The acutest German, the lovingest disciple, could never tell what Platonism was; indeed, admirable texts can be quoted on both sides of every great question from him. These things we are forced to say if we must consider the effort of Plato or of any philosopher to dispose of nature-which will not be disposed of. No power of genius has ever yet had the smallest success in explaining existence. The perfect enigma remains. But there is an injustice in assuming this ambition for Plato. Let us not seem to treat with flippancy his venerable name. Men, in proportion to their intellect, have admitted his tran- scendent claims. The way to know him is to compare him, not with nature, but with other men.

The great-eyed Plato proportioned the lights and shades after the genius of our life. PLATO: NEW READINGS THE publication, in 1fr.

Then perinds must pass before the motion of the earth can be suspected; then before the map of the instincts and the cultivable powers can he draml. But as of races, so the succession of individual men is fatal and beautiful, and Plato has the fortune in the history of mankind to mark an epoch. Plato's fame does not stand on a syllogism, or on any master ... pieces of the Socratic reasoning, or on any thesis, as for example the immortality of the soul. He is more than an expert, or 'a schoolman, or a geometer, or the prophet of a peculiar message. He represents the privilege of the intellect, the power, namely, of carrying up every fact to successive platforms and so disclosing in every fact a germ of expansion. These expansions are in the essence of thought. The naturalist would never help us to them by any discoveries of the extent of the universe, but is as poor when cataloguing the resolved nebula of Orion, as", "to successive platforms and so disclosing in every fact a germ of expansion. These expansions are in the essence of thought. The naturalist would never help us to them by any discoveries of the extent of the universe, but is as poor when cataloguing the resolved nebula of Orion, as when measur4 ing the angles of an acre. But the Republic of Plato, by these expansions, may be said to require and so to anticipate the astronomy of Laplace. The expansions are organic. The mind does not create what it perceives, any more than the eye creates the rose. In ascribing to Plato the merit of anoouncing them, 494 P L A TO; 0 R, THE PHI LOS 0 P HER we only say, Here was a more complete man, who could apply to nature the whole scale of the senses, the understanding and the reason. These expansions or extensions consist in continuing the spiritual sight where the horizon falls on our natural vision, and by this second sight discovering the long lines of law which shoot in every direction. Everywhere he stands on a path which has no end, but runs continuously round the universe. Therefore every word becomes an exponent of nature. Whatever he looks upon discloses a second sense, and ulterior senses. His percep- tion of the generation of contraries, of death out of life and life out of death-that law by which, in nature, decomposition is recomposition, and putrefaction and cholera are only signals of a new creation; his discernment of the little in the large and the large in the small; studying the state in the citizen and the citizen in the state; and leaving it doubtful whether he exhibited the Republic as a.n allegory on the education of the private soul; his beautiful definitions", "new creation; his discernment of the little in the large and the large in the small; studying the state in the citizen and the citizen in the state; and leaving it doubtful whether he exhibited the Republic as a.n allegory on the education of the private soul; his beautiful definitions of ideas, of time, of form, of figure, of the line, sometimes hypothetically given, as his defining of vir- tue, courage, justice, temperance; his love of the apologue, and I tis apologues themselves; the cave of Trophonius; the ring of , ;yges; the charioteer and two horses; the golden, silver, brass and iron temperaments; Theuth and Thamus; and the visions of Hades and the Fates-fables which have imprinted themselves in the human memory like the signs of the zodiac; his soliform eye and his boniform soul; his doctrine of assimilation; his doc- trine of reminiscence; his clear vision of the laws of return, or reaction, which secure instant justice throughout the universe, instanced everywhere, but specially in the doctrine, \"what comes from God to us, returns from us to God,\" and in Socrates' belief that the laws below are sisters of the laws above. ~Iore striking examples are his moral conclusions. Plato affirms the coincidence of science and virtue; for vice can never know itself and virtue, but virtue knows both itself and vice. The eye 9.ttested that justice was best, as long as it was profitable; Plato affirms that it is profitable throughout; that the profit is intrin- sic, though the just conceal his justice from gods and men; that it is better to suffer iniustice than to do it; that the sinner ought PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER 495 to covet punishment; that the lie was more hurtiul than homi- cide; and that ignorance. or the involuntary lie. was", "though the just conceal his justice from gods and men; that it is better to suffer iniustice than to do it; that the sinner ought PLATO; OR, THE PHILOSOPHER 495 to covet punishment; that the lie was more hurtiul than homi- cide; and that ignorance. or the involuntary lie. was more calami- tous than involuntary homicide: that the soul is unwillingly deprived of true opinions, and that no man sins \"\"illingly: that the order or proceeding of nature was from the n1ind to the body, and, though a sound body cannot restore an unsound mind~ yet a good soul can, by its virtue, render the body the best possible .. The intelligent have a right o\\\u00b7er the ignorant nalnely~ the right of instructing them. The right punishment of one out of tune is to make him play in tune; the fine ,,\u00b7hich the good\" refusing to govern, ought to pay, is, to be governed by a ,,\"\"orse man: that his guards shall not handle gold and silver: but shall be instructed that there is gold and silver in their souls, which will nlake men willing to give them every thing which they need. This second sight explains the stress laid on geometry. He saw that the globe of earth was not more la'W'iul and precise than was the supersensible; that a celestial geometry was in place there, as a logic of lines and angles here below; that the world was throughout mathematical; the proportions are constant of oxygen, azote and lime; there is just so much water and slate and magnesia; not less are the proportions constant oi the moral elements.

This eldest Goethe, hating varnish and falsehood~ delighted in revealing the real at the base of the accidental; in discovering connection, continuity and representation eYery\"'Where, hating insulation; and appears like the god of wealth among the cabins of vagabonds, opening power and capability in everything he touches .. Ethical science was new and vacant \"\"hen Plato could write thus: \"Of all whose arguments are left to the men of the present time, no one has ever yet condemned injustice, or praised justice, otherwise than as respects the repute, honors and emolu- ments arising therefrom; while, as respects either of them in itself, and subsisting by its own power in the soul of the pos .. sessar, and concealed both from gods and men, no one has yet sufficiently investigated, either in poetry or prose writings-how, namely, that injustice is the greatest of all the evils that the soul has within it, and justice the greatest good.\" 496 P LA TO; 0 R, THE PHI LOS 0 P HER His definition of ideas, as what is simple, permanent, uniform and self-existent, forever discriminating them from the notions of the understanding, marks an era in the world. He was born to behold the self-evolving power of spirit, endless, generator of new ends; a power which is the key at once to the centrality and the evanescence of things. Plato is so centred that he can well spare all his dogmas. Thus the fact of knowledge and ideas reveals to him the fact of eternity; and the doctrine of reminis- cence he offers as the most probable particular explication. Call that fanciful-it matters not: the connection between our knowl- edge and the", "centred that he can well spare all his dogmas. Thus the fact of knowledge and ideas reveals to him the fact of eternity; and the doctrine of reminis- cence he offers as the most probable particular explication. Call that fanciful-it matters not: the connection between our knowl- edge and the abyss of being is still real, and the explication must be not less magnificent. He has indicated every eminent point in speculation. He wrote on the scale of the mind itself, so that all things have symmetry in his tablet. He put in all the past, without weariness, and descended into detail with a courage like that he witnessed in nature .. One would say that his forerunners had mapped out each a farm or a district or an island, in intellectual geography, but that Plato first drew the sphere. He domesticates the soul in nature: man is the microcosm. All the circles of the visible heaven represent as many circles in the rational soul. There is no lawless particle, and there is nothing casual in the action of the human mind. The names of things, too, are fatal, folloviing the nature of things ... .'\u00a3\\.11 the gods of the Pantheon are, by their names, significant of a profound sense. The gods are the ideas.

It desires to keep open every avenue to the competition of all, and to mUltiply avenues: the class of business men in America, in England~ in France and throughout Europe~ the class of industry and skill. Napoleon is its representative. The instinct of active, bra,\\Te, able meo, throughout the middle class every where, has pointed out Napoleon as the incarnate Democrat. He had their virtues and 501 502 NAP 0 LEO N; MAN 0 F THE W 0 R L D tb.eir vices; above all, he bad their spirit or aim. That tendent-;\" is material, pointing at a sensual success and employing the richest and most various means to that end; conversant with mechanical powers, highly intellectual, widely and accurately learned and skilful, but subordinating all intellectual and spiritual forces into means to a material success. To be the rich man, is the end. \"God has granted,\" says the Koran, \"to every people a prophet in its own tongue.\" Paris and London and New York, the spirit of commerce, of money and material power, were also to have their prophet; and Bonaparte was qualified and sent.

Everyone of the million readers of anecdotes or memoirs or lives of Napoleon, delights in the page, because he studies in it his own history. Napoleon is thoroughly modern, and, at the highest point of his fortunes, has the very spirit of the news- papers. He is no sain1.-to use his own \"Tord, \"no capuchin,\" and he is no hero, in the high sense. The man in the street finds in him the qualities and powers of other men in the street. He finds bim, like himself, by birth a citizen, who, by very intelligible merits, arrived at such a commanding position that he could indulge all those tastes which the common man possesses but is obliged to conceal and deny:, good so~iety, good books, fast travelling, dress, dinners, servants without number, personal weight, the execution of his ideas, the standing in the attitude of a benefactor to all persons about him, the refined enjoyments of pictures, statues, music, palaces and conventional honors- precisely what is agreeable to the heart of every man in the nineteenth century, this powerful man possessed. It is true that a man of Napoleon's truth of adaptation to the mind of the masses around him, becomes not merely repre- sentative but actually a monopolizer and usurper of other minds.

Napoleon renounced, once for all, sentiments and affections, and would help himself with his hands and his head. With him is no miracle and no magic. He is a worker in brass, in iron, in 'Wood, in earth, in roads, in buildings, in money and in troops, and a very consistent and wise master-vvorkman. He is never weak and literary, but acts with the solidity and the precision of natural agents. He has not lost his native sense and sympathy with things. ~1en give way before such a man, as before natural events. To be sure there are men enough who are immersed in things, as farmers, smiths, sailors and mechanics generally; and we know how real and solid such men appear in the presence of scholars and grammarians: but these men ordinarily lack the power of arrangeme!lt, and are like hands without a head.

His favorite rhetoric lay in allusion to his star~ and be pleased himself .. as well as the people, when he styled himself the ~'Child of Destiny.\" \"They charge me,\" he said, \"with the commission of great crimes: men of my stamp do not commit crimes.

He is a realist, terrific to all talkers and confused truth-obscuring persons. He sees where the matter hinges, throws himself on the precise point of resistance, and slights all other considerations .. He is strong in the right manner, namely by insight. He never blundered into victory, but won his battles in his head before he won them on the field. His principal means are in himself. He asks counsel of no other. In 1796 he writes to the Directory: \"1 have conducted the campaign without consulting anyone. I should have done no good if I had been under the necessity of conforming to the notions of another per- son .. I have gained some advantages over superior forces and when totally destitute of every thing, because, in the persuasion that your confidence was reposed in me, my actions were as prompt as my thoughts.\" History is full, down to this day, of the imbecility of kings and governors.

They are a class of persons much to be pitied, for they know not what they should do. The weavers strike for bread, and the king and his ministers, knowing not what to do, meet them with bayonets. But Napoleon understood his business. Here was a man who in each moment and emergency knew what to do next. It is an immense comfort and refreshment to the spirits, not only of kings, but of citizens. Few men have any next; they live from hand to mouth, without plan, and are ever at the end of their line, and after each action wait for an impulse from abroad. Napoleon bad been the first man of the world, if his ends had been purely public. As he is, he inspires confidence and vigor by the extraordinary unity of his action. He is firm, sure, self-denying, self\"postponing, sacrificing every thing- money, troops, generals, and his own safety also, to his aim; not misled, like common adventurers, by the splendor of his own means. '~Incidents ought not to govern policy,\" he said, \"but policy, incidents.\" \"To be hurried away by every event is to have no political system at all.\" His victories were only so many doors, and he never for a moment lost sight of his way onward, in the dazzle and uproar of the present circumstance.

He laid bis bones to, and wrought for his croWD. Having decided what was to be done, be did that with might and main. He put out all his strength .. He risked every thing and spared nothing, neither ammunition, nor money, nor troops, nor generals, nor himself. \\Ve like to see every thing do its office after its kind, whethet it be a milch-cow or a rattlesnake; and if fighting be the best. mode of adjusting national differences (as large majorities of 508 NAP 0 LEO N; MAN 0 F THE W 0 R L D men seem to agree), certainly Bonaparte was right in making it thorough. The grand principle of war, he said, was that an ' army ought always to be ready, by day and by night and at all hours, to make all the resistance it is capable of making. He never economized his ammunition, but, on a hostile position, rained a torrent of iron-shells, balls, grape-shot-to annihilate all defence.

He never economized his ammunition, but, on a hostile position, rained a torrent of iron-shells, balls, grape-shot-to annihilate all defence. On any point of resistance he concentrated squadron on squadron in overwhelming numbers until it was swept out of existence. To a regiment of horse-chasseurs at Lobenstein, two days before the battle of J ena, Napoleon said, \"My lads, you must not fear death; when soldiers brave death, they drive him into the enemy's ranks.\" In the fury of assault, he no more spared himself. He went to the edge of his possibility. It is plain that in Italy he did what he could, and all that he could. He came, several times, within an inch of ruin; and his own person was all but lost. He was flung into the marsh at Arcola. The Austrians were between him and his troops, in the melee, and he was brought off with desperate efforts. At Lonato, and at other places, he was on the point of being taken prisoner. He fought sixty battles. He had never enough. Each victory was a new weapon. \"1vly power would fall, were I not to support it by new achievements. Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest must nlaintain me.\" He felt, with every wise man, that as much life is needed for conservation as for creation. We are always in peril, always in a bad plight, just on the edge of destruction and only to be saved by invention and courage. This vigor was guarded and tempered by the coldest prudence and punctuality. A thunderbolt in the attack, he was found invul- nerable in his intrenchments.

This vigor was guarded and tempered by the coldest prudence and punctuality. A thunderbolt in the attack, he was found invul- nerable in his intrenchments. His very attack was never the inspiration of courage, but the result or calculation. His idea of the best defence consists in being still the attacking party. \"My ambition,\" he says, \"was great, but was of a cold nature.\" In one of his conversations with Las Cases, he remarked, \"As to the moral courage, I have rarely met with the two-o'clock-in-the .. morning kind: I mean unprepared courage; that which is neces- sary on an unexpected occasion, and which, in spite of the most unforeseen events, leaves full freedom of judgment and deci ..

Every thing depended on the nicety of his combinations, and the stars were not more punctual than his arithmetic. His personal attention descended to the smallest particulars. \u00b7\u00b7 . .\\t :\\Iontebello, I ordered Kellermann to attack with eight hundred horse, and \"\"' with these he separated the six thousand Hungarian grenadiers, before the verv eves of the .A.ustrian cavalry.

His instructions to his secretarY at .. the Tuileries are worth remembering .. \"During the night, enter my chamber as seldom as possible. Do not awake me when you have any good news to communicate; with that there is no hurry. But when you bring bad news, rouse me instantly, for then there is not a moment to be lost.\" It was a whimsical econ .. omy of the same kind which dictated his practice, when general in Italy, in regard to his burdensome correspondence. He directed Bourrienne to leave all letters unopened for three weeks, and then observed with satisfaction how large a part of the corre- spondence had thus disposed of itself and no longer required an answer. His achievement of business was immense, and enlarges the known powers of man. There have been many working kings, from Ulysses to \\,,\\Tilliam of Orange, but none who accomplished a tithe of this man's performance. To these gifts of nature, Napoleon added the advantage of having been born to a private and humble fortune. In his later days he had the weakness of wishing to add to his crowns and badges the prescription of aristocracy; but he knew his debt to his austere education, and made no secret of his contempt for the born kings1 and", "been born to a private and humble fortune. In his later days he had the weakness of wishing to add to his crowns and badges the prescription of aristocracy; but he knew his debt to his austere education, and made no secret of his contempt for the born kings1 and for \"the hereditary asses,\" as be coarsely SIO NAP 0 LEO N; MAN 0 F THE W 0 R L D styled the Bourbons. He said that \"in their exile they had learned nothing, and forgot nothing.\" Bonaparte had passed through all the degrees of military service, but also was citizen before he was emperor, and so has the key to citizenship. His remarks and estimates discover the information and justness of measurement of the middle class. Those who had to deal with hhn found that he was not to be imposed upon, but could cipher as well as another man. This appears in all parts of his Memoirs, dictated at St. Helena. When the expenses of the empress, of hi; household, of his palaces, had accumulated great debts, Napoleon examined the bills of the creditors himself, detected overcharges and errors, and reduced the claims by considerable sums. His grand weapon, namely the millions whom he directed, he -owed to the representative character which clothed him. He interests us as he stands for France and for Europe; and he exists as captain and king only as far as the Revolution, or the interest of the industrious masses, found an organ and a leader in him. In the social interests, be knew the meaning and value of labor, and threw himself naturally on that side. I like an incident mentioned by one of his biographers at St. Helena. \"When walking with Mrs. Balcombe, some servants, carrying heavy boxes, passed by on", "and a leader in him.

I like an incident mentioned by one of his biographers at St. Helena. \"When walking with Mrs. Balcombe, some servants, carrying heavy boxes, passed by on the road, and Mrs. Balcombe desired iliem, in rather an angry tone, to keep back. Napoleon interfered, saying 'Respect the burden, l\\ladame.'\" In the time of the empire he directed attention to the improvement and embellish- ment of the markets of the capital. \"The market-place,\" he said, \"is the Louvre of the common people.\" The principal works that have survived him are his magnificent roads. He filled the troops with his spirit, and a sort of freedom and companionship grew up between him and them, which the fonns of his court never permitted between the officers and himself. They per- formed, under his eye, that which no others could do. The best document of his reI a tion to his troops is the order of the day on the morning of the battle of Austerlitz, in which Napoleon prom- ises the troops that he will keep his person out of reach of fire.

He knew, as well as any J acobin in France, ho,\\y to philosophize on liberty and equality; and when allusion \\vas made to the precious blood of centuries, which was spilled by the killing oi the Due d'Enghien, he suggested, '~X either is my blood ditch-\\vater.\" The people felt that no longer the throne was occupied and the land sucked of its nourishment, by a small class of legitimates, se- cluded from all community with the children of the soil, and holding the ideas and superstitions of a long-forgotten state of society. Instead of that vampyre, a man of themselV'es held1 in the Tuileries, knowledge and ideas like their own, opening of course to them and their children all places of power and trust. The day of sleepy, selfish policy, ever narrowing the means and opportunities of young men, was ended, and a day of e:\\.'J)ansion and demand was come. A market for all the powers and produc- tions of man was opened; brilliant prizes glittered in the eyes of youth and talent.

In 1814, when advised to rely on the higher classes, Napoleon said to those around him, \"Gentlemen, in the situation in which I stand, my only nobility is the rabble of the Faubourgs.\" Napoleon met this natural expectation. The necessity of hi9 position required a hospitality to every sort of ta\u00b7lent., and its appointment to trusts; and his feeling went along with this 512 NAP OLE ON; MAN 0 F THE WORL D policy. Like every superior person, he undoubtedly felt a desire for men and compeers, and a wish to measure his power with other masters, and an impatience of fools and underlings. In Italy, he sought for men and found none. \"Good God!\" he said, \"how rare men are! There are eighteen millions in Italy, and I !lave with difficulty found two-Dandolo and Melzi.\" In later years, with larger experience, his respect for mankind was not in- creased. In a moment of bitterness he said to one of his oldest friends, \"l\\len deserve the contempt with which they inspire me .. I have only to put some gold-lace on the coat of my virtuous republicans and they immediately become just what I wish them.\" This impatience at levity was, however, an oblique tribute of respect to those able persons who commanded his regard not only when he found them friends and coadjutors but", "only to put some gold-lace on the coat of my virtuous republicans and they immediately become just what I wish them.\" This impatience at levity was, however, an oblique tribute of respect to those able persons who commanded his regard not only when he found them friends and coadjutors but also when they resisted his will. He could not confound Fox and Pitt, Car- not, Lafayette and Bernadotte, with the danglers of his court; and in spite of the detraction which his systematic egotism dic- tated toward the great captains who conquered with and for him, ample acknowledgments are made by him to Lannes, Duroe, Kleber, Dessaix, J\\Iassena, J\\lurat, Ney and Augereau. If he felt himself their patron and the founder of their fortunes, as when be said '~I made my generals out of mud\"-he could not hide his satisfaction in receiving from them a seconding and sup- port commensurate with the grandeur of his enterprise. In the Russian campaign he was so much impressed by the courage a.nd resources of ~larshal Ney, that he said, \"I have two hundred millions in my coffers, and I would give them all for Ney.\" The characters which he has drawn of several of his marshals are mscriminating, and though they did not content the insatiable \\Tanity of French officers, are no doubt substantially just. And in fact every species of merit was sought and advanced under his government. ':1 know,\" he said, Clthe depth and draught of water of every cne of my generals.\" Natural power was sure to be well received at his court.

The lesson he teaches is that which vigor", "as a model of prudence. His power does not consist in any wild or extravagant force; in any enthusiasm like ~fahomet's, or singular power of persuasion; but in the exercise of common-sense on each emergency, instead of abiding by rules and customs. The lesson he teaches is that which vigor always teaches-that there is always room for it. To what heaps of cowardly doubts is not that man's life an answer. When be appeared it was the belief of all military men that there could be nothing new in war; as it is the belief of men to-day that nothing new can be undertaken in politics, or in church, or in letters, or in trade, or in farming, or in our social manners and customs; and as it is at all times the belief of society that the world is used up. But Bonaparte knew better than society; and moreover knew that he knew better. I think all men know better than they do; know that the institutions we so volubly commend are go-carts and baubles; but they dare not trust their presenti- ments. Bonaparte relied on his own sense, and did not care a bean for other people's. The world treated his novelties just as it treats everybody's novelties-made infinite objection, mustered all the impediments; but he snapped his finger at their objections. 'O:\\Vbat creates great difficulty,\" he remarks, \"in the profession of the land-commander, is the necessity of feeding so many men and animals. If he allows himself to be guided by the commis- saries he will never stir, and all his expeditions will fail.\" An example of his common-sense is what he says of the passage of the ..

He delighted in run- ning through the range of practical, of literary and of abstract questions. His opinion is al\\\\Tays original and to the purpose. On the voyage to Egypt he liked, after dinner, to fi..x on three or four persons to support a proposition, and as many to oppose it. He gave a subject, and the discussions turned on questions of religion: the different kinds of government, and the art of ,,\"ar. One day he asked whether the planets were inhabited .. On another, what was the age of the world. Then he proposed to consider the probability of the destruction of the globe, eithel by water or by fire: at another time, the truth or fallacy of presentiments, and the interpretation of dreams .. He was very fond of talking of religion. In 1806 he conversed with Fournier, bishop of ~Iontpellier, on matters of theology. There were t,yO points on which they could not agree, viz. that of hell, and that of salvation out of the pale of the church. The Emperor told Josephine that he disputed like a devil on these two points, on. which the bishop was inexorable. To the philosophers he readily yielded all that was proved against religion as the work of men and time, but he would not hear of materialisnl. One fine night, on deck, amid a clatter of materialism, Bonaparte pointed to the stars, and said, \"\\: ... ou may talk as", "inexorable.

Why throw ob- stacles in the way of its defence? Its own means are superior to all the apparatus of your laboratories. Corvisart candidly agreed with me that all your filthy mixtures are good for noth- ing. lVledicine is a collection of uncertain prescriptions, the re .. sults of which, taken collectively, are more fatal than useful to mankind. Water, air and cleanliness are the chief articles in my pharmacopceia.' , His memoirs, dictated to Count Montholol7l and General Gour- gaud at St. Helena, have great value, after all the deduction that it seems is to be made from them on account of his known dis- ingenuJ)usness.

The most agree ... able portion is the Campaign in Egypt. He had hours of thought and wisdom. In intervals of leisure, either in the camp or the palace, Napoleon appears as a man of genius directing on abstract questions the native appetite for truth and the impatience of words he was wont to show in war. He could enjoy every play of invention, a romance, a bon mot, as well as a stratagem in a campaign. He delighted to fascinate Josephine and her ladies, in a dim-lighted apartment, by the terrors of a fiction to which his voice and dramatic power lent every addition. I call Napoleon the agent or attorney of the middle class of modern society; of the throng who fill the markets shops \u00b7 h ' , c~u~bng- auses,. manufactories, ships, of the modern world, aImmg to be rIch. He was the agitator, the destroyer of prescription, th.e internal improv~A' the liberal, the radical, the NAPOLEON; MAN OF~ THE WORLD 511 inventor of means, the opener of doors and markets, the sub- verter of monopoly and abuse. Of course the rich and aristocratic did not like him .. England, the centre of capital, and Rome and Austria, centres of tradition and genealogy, opposed him.

He had the virtues of the masses of his constitu- ents: he had also their vices. I am sorry that the brilliant picture has its reverse. But that is the fatal quality which we discover in our pursuit of wealth, that it is treacherous, ana is bought by the breaking or weakening of the sentiments; and it is inevitable that we should find the same fact in the history of this champion, who proposed to himself simply a brilliant career, without any stipulation or scruple concerning the means. Bonaparte was singularly destitute of generous sentiments. The highest-placed individual in the most cultivated age and population of the world-he has not the merit of common truth and honesty. He is unjust to his generals; egotistic and monopo .. lizing; meanly stealing the credit of their great actions from Kellermann, from Bernadotte; intriguing to involve his faithful Junot in hopeless bankruptcy, in order to drive him to a distance from Paris, because the familiarity of his manners offends the new pride of his throne. He is a boundless liar. The official paper, his \"Moniteur,\" and all his bulletins, are proverbs for saying what he wished to be believed; and worse-he sat, in his premature old age, in his lonely", "from Paris, because the familiarity of his manners offends the new pride of his throne. He is a boundless liar. The official paper, his \"Moniteur,\" and all his bulletins, are proverbs for saying what he wished to be believed; and worse-he sat, in his premature old age, in his lonely island, coldly falsifying facts and dates and characters, and giving to history a theatrical eclat. Like all Frenchmen he has a passion for stage effect. Every action that breathes of generosity is poisoned by this c~lculation. His star, his love of glory, his doctrine of the immortality of the soul, are all French. \"I must dazzle and astonish. If I were to give the liberty of the press, my power could not last three days.\" To SIS NAPOLE01V~ MAN OF THE WORLD make a great noise is his favorite design. ,eA great reputation is a great noise: the more there is made, the farther off it is heard. Laws institutions, monuments, nations, all fall; but the noise conti~ues, and resounds in after ages.\" His doctrine, of immor- tality is simply fame. His theory of influence is not flattering. \"There are two levers for moving men-interest and fear. Love is a silly infatuation, depend upon it. Friendship is but a name. I love nobody. I do not even love my brothers: perhaps Joseph a little, from habit, and because he is my elder; and Duroe, I love him too; but why?-because his character pleases me: he is stern and resolute, and I believe the fellow never shed a tear. For lny part I know very well that I have no true friends. As long as I continue to be what I am, I may have as many pre- tended friends as I please.

As long as I continue to be what I am, I may have as many pre- tended friends as I please. Leave sensibility to women; but Olen sLould be firm in heart and purpose, or they should have noth .. ing to do with war and government.\" He was thoroughly un ... scrupulous. He would steal, slander, assassinate, drown and poi- son, as his interest dictated. He had no generosity, but mere vulgar hatred~ he was intensely selfish; he was perfidious; he cheated at cards; he was a prodigious gossip, and opened letters, d.nd delighted in his infamous police, and rubbed his hands with joy when he had intercepted some morsel of intelligence concern- ing the men ana women about him, boasting that \"he knew every t bing; \" and interfered with the cutting the dresses of the women; 'and listened after the hurrahs and the compliments of the street, incognito. HjE; manners were coarse. He treated women with low familiarity. lIe had the habit of pulling their ears and pinching their cheeks when he was in good humor, and of pulling the ears and whiskers of men, and of striking and horse .. play with them, to bis last days. It does not appear that he listened at key- holes, or at least that he was caught at it. In short, when you !lave penetrated through all tbe circles of power and splendor, rou were not dealing with a gentleman, at last; but with an anp?stor an~ a rogue; and he fully deserves the epithet of Tuptter Scap'l'1t, or a sort of Scamp Jupiter . .

I omitted then to say, what is material to the statement, namely that these two parties differ only as young and old. The democrat is a young conservative; the conservative is an old democrat. The aristocrat is the democrat ripe and gone to seed-because both parties stand on the one ground of the supreme value of property, which one endeavors to get, and the other to keep. Bonaparte may be said to represent the whole history of this party, its youth and its age; yes, and with poetic justice its fate, in his own. The counter- revolution, the counter-party, still waits for its organ and repre- sentative, in a lover and a man of truly public and universal aims. Here was an experiment, under the most favorable conditions, of the powers of intellect without conscience. Never was such a leader so endowed and so weaponed; never leader found such aids and followers. And what was the result of thi's vast talent and power, of these immense armies, burned cities, squandered treasures, immolated millions of men, of this demoralized Eu- rope? It came to no result.

Men found that his absorbing egotism was deadly to all other men. It resembled the torpedo, which in- flicts a succession of shocks on anyone who takes hold of it, producing spasms which contract the muscles of the hand, so that the man can not open his fingers; and the animal inflicts new and more violent shocks, until he paralyzes and kills his victim. So this exorbitant egotist narrowed, impoverished and absorbed the power and existence of those who served him; ann the uni ... versa! cry of France and of Europe in I8I4 was, \"Enough of him;\" ltAssez de Bonaparte.\" 520 NAP 0 LEO N; Iv.'[ A N 0 F r HEW 0 R L D It was not Bonaparte's fault.

As long as our civilization is essentially one of property, of fences, of exclusive- ness, it will be mocked by delusions.

EN GLISH TRAITS (Emerson first visited England in 1833 at a time when he was in low spirits and poor health. His first wife had just died. One of his brothers had just broken down from over-work. He had just resigned his pulpit in Boston and had to find a new career. Since he had published nothing, he was unknown in England. He made an e flort to seek out writers there in whom he was interested-especially Wordsworth, Coleridge and Carlyle. His second visit occurred i,,- 1847 by invitation from people who had read h'tfIJ books and wanted to see him. During the winter he ~ectured extensively in England and Scotland, and had an opportunity to meet a great many people. After his return to America he read lectures on Eng- lish traits.

In 1856, he published the book oj thllJ title.] ENGLISH TRAITS CHAPTER I FIRST VISIT TO ENG1~AND I HAVE been twice to England. In r833, ron my return frold a short tour in Sicily, Italy and France, I crossed from Boulogne and landed in London at the TO\\lver stair:~. It was a dark Sun- day morning; there were feV'T people in the streets, and Ire .. member the pleasure of that first walk on English gruund, with my companion, aq American artist, from the Tower up through Cheapside and the Strand to a house in Russell Square, whither we had been recommended to good chambers. For the first tinle for many months Vie were forced to check the saucy habit of travellers' criticisnl, as we could no longer speak aloud in the streets without being understood. The shop-signs spoke our Ian ... guage; our country names were on the door-plates, and the public and private buildings wore a more native and wonted front .. Like most young men at that time, I was much indebted to the men of Edinburgh and of the Edinburgh Review-to Jeffrey, Mackintosh, Hallam, and to Scott, Playfair and De Quincey; and my narrow and desultory reading had inspired the wish to see the faces of three or four writers-Coleridge, Wordsworth, Landor, De Quincey, and the latest and strongest contributor to the critical journals, Carlyle; and I suppose if I had sifted the reasons that led me to Europe, when I was ill and was advised to travel, it was mainly the attraction of these persons. If Goethe had been still living I might have wandered into Germany also.

If Goethe had been still living I might have wandered into Germany also. Besides those I have named (for Scott was dead), there was not in Britain the man living whom I cared to behold, unless it were the Duke of Wellington, whom I afterwards saw at Westminster Abbey at the funeral of Wilberforce. The young scholar fancies it happiness enough to live with people who can give an inside to ~he world; without reflecting that they are prisoners too, of 523 ENGLISH TRAITS their own thought, and cannot apply themselves to yours. The conditions of literary success are almost destructive of the best social power, as they do not leave that frolic liberty which only can encounter a companion on the best terms. It is probable you left some obscure comrade at a tavern, or in the farms, with right mother-wit and equality to life, when you crossed sea and land to play bo-peep with celebrated scribes. I have, however, found writers superior to their books, and I cling to my first belief that a strong bead will dispose fast enough of these impediments and give one the satisfaction of reality, the sense of having been met, and a larger horizon. Onlooking over the diary of my journey in 1833, I find nothing to publish in my memoranda of visits to places. But I have copied the few notes I made of visits to persons, as they respect parties quite too good and too transparent to the whole world to make it needful to affect any prudery of suppression about a few hints of those bright personalities.

At Florence, chief among artists I found Horatio Greenough, the American sculptor. His face was so handsome and his person so well formed that he might be pardoned, if, as was alleged, the face of his Medora and the figure of a colossal Achilles in clay, were idealizations of his own. Greenough was a superior man, ardent and eloquent, and all his opinions had elevation and mag- nanimity. He believed that the Greeks had wrought in schools or fraternities-the genius of the master imparting his design to his friends and inflaming them with it, and when his strength was spent, a new hand with equal heat continued the work; and so by relays, until it was finished in every part with equal fire. This was necessary in so refractory a material as stone; and he thought art would never prosper until we left our shy jealous ways and worked in society as they. All his thoughts breathed the same generosity. He was an accurate and a deep man. He was a votary of the Greeks, and impatient of Gothic art. His paper on Architecture, published in 1843, announced in advance the leading thoughts of 1fr .. Ruskin on the morality in architecture, notwithstanding the antagonism in their views of the history of #U\"t. I have a private letter from him-later, but respecting the ENGLISH TRAITS same period-in which he roughly sketches his own theory. \"Here is my theory of structure: A scientific arrangement of spaces and forms to functions and to site; an emphasis of features propor- tioned", "of the history of #U\"t. I have a private letter from him-later, but respecting the ENGLISH TRAITS same period-in which he roughly sketches his own theory. \"Here is my theory of structure: A scientific arrangement of spaces and forms to functions and to site; an emphasis of features propor- tioned to their gradated importance in function; color and orna- ment to be decided and arranged and varied by strictly organic laws, having a distinct ,reason for each decision; the entire and immediate banishment of all make-shift and make-believe.\" Greenough brought me, through a common friend, an invita- tion from Mr. Landor, who lived at San Domenica di Fiesole. On the I5th May I dined with Mr. Landor. I found him noble and courteous, living in a cloud of pictures at his Villa Gherar .. desca, a fine house commanding a beautiful landscape. I had in ... ferred from his books, or magnified from some anecdotes, an im .. pression of Achillean wrath-an untamable petulance. I do not know whether the imputation were just or not, but certainly on this May day his courtesy veiled that haughty mind and he was the most patient and gentle of hosts. He praised the beautiful cyclamen which grows all about Florence; he admired Wash- ington; talked of Wordsworth, Byron, Massinger, Beaumont and Fletcher. To be sure, he is decided in his opinions, likes to surprise, and is well content to impress, if possible,' his English whim upon the immutable past. No great man ever had a great son, if Philip and Alexander be not an excep- tion; and Philip he calls the greater man. In art, he loves the Greeks, and in sculpture, them only. He prefers the Venus to everything else, and, after that, the head of Alexander, in the gallery here. He", "had a great son, if Philip and Alexander be not an excep- tion; and Philip he calls the greater man. In art, he loves the Greeks, and in sculpture, them only. He prefers the Venus to everything else, and, after that, the head of Alexander, in the gallery here. He prefers John of Bologna to Michael Angelo; in painting, Raffaelle, and shares the growing taste for Perugino and the early masters. The Greek histories he thought the only good; and after them, Voltaire's. I could not make him praise Mackintosh, nor my more recent friends; Montaigne very cor- dially-and Charron also, which seemed undiscriminating. He thought Degerando indebted to \"Lucas on Happiness\" and \"Lucas on Holiness\"! He pestered me with Southey; but who is Southey? He invited me to breakfast on Friday. On Friday r did not fail to go, and this time with Greenough. He entertained us at once ENGLISH TRAITS with reciting half a dozen hexameter lines of Julius Cresar'sl- from Donatus, he said. He glorified Lord Chesterfield more than was necessary, and undervalued Burke, and undervalued Soc .. rates; designated as three of the greatest of men, Washington, Phocion and Timoleon-much as our pomologists, in their lists, select the three or the six best pears \"for a small orchard;\"- and did not even omit to remark the similar termination of their names. \"A great man,\" he said, \"should make great sacrifices and kill his hundred oxen without knowing whether they would be consumed 'by gods and heroes, or whether the flies would eat them.\" I had visited Professor Amici, who had shown me his microscopes, magnifying (it was said) two thousand diameters; and I spoke of the uses to which they were applied. Landor despised entomology, yet, in the same breath, said, \"the sublime was in a", "or whether the flies would eat them.\" I had visited Professor Amici, who had shown me his microscopes, magnifying (it was said) two thousand diameters; and I spoke of the uses to which they were applied. Landor despised entomology, yet, in the same breath, said, \"the sublime was in a grain of dust.\" I suppose I teased him about recent writers, but he professed never to have heard of Herschel, not even by name. One room was full of pictures, which he likes to show, especially one piece, standing before which he said \"he would give fifty guineas t.o the man that would swear it was a Domenichino.\" I was more curious to see his library, but Mr .. H , one of the guests, told me that Mr. Landor gives away his books and has never more than a dozen at a time in his house. Mr .. Landor carries to its height the love of freak which the English delight to indulge, as if to signalize their commanding freedom~ He has a wonderful brain, ,despotic, violent and inex ... haustible, meant for a soldier, by what chance converted to let ... ters; in which there is not a style nor a tint not known to him, yet with an English appetite for action and heroes. The thing done avails, and not what is said about it. An original sentence, a step forward, is worth more than all the censures. Landor is strangely undervalued in England; usually ignored and some ... times savagely attacked in the Reviews. The criticism may be right or wrong, and is quickly forgotten; but year after year the scholar must still go back to Landor for a multitude of ele .. gant sentences; for wisdom, wit, and indignation that are un- forgettable.

ENGLISH TRAITS From London, on the 5th August, I went to Highgate, and wrote a note to Mr. Coleridge, requesting leave to pay my re- spects to him. It was near nOOD. Mr. Coleridge sent a verbal message that he was in bed, but if I would call after one o'clock he would see me. I returned at one, and he appeared, a short, thick old man, with bright blue eyes and fine clear complexion, leaning on his cane. He took snuff freely, which presently soiled his cravat and neat black. suit. He asked whether I knew Allston, and spoke warmly of his merits and doings when he knew him in ROIne; what a master of the Titianesque he was, etc., etc. He spoke of Dr. Channing. It was an unspeakable misfortune that he should have turned out a Unitarian after alL On this . . he burst into a declanlation on the folly and ignorance of Uni .. tarianism-its high unreasonableness; and taking up Bishop Waterland's book, which lay on the table, he read with vehe .. mence two or three pages written by himself in the fly-leaves- passages, too, which, I believe, are printed in the Aids to Re .. flection. When he stopped to take breath, I interposed that \"whilst I highly valued all his explanations, I was bound to tell him that I was born and bred a Unitarian.\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"I supposed so;\" and continued as before. It was a wonder that after so many ages", "flection. When he stopped to take breath, I interposed that \"whilst I highly valued all his explanations, I was bound to tell him that I was born and bred a Unitarian.\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"I supposed so;\" and continued as before. It was a wonder that after so many ages of unquestioning acquiescence in the doct.rine of St. Paul-the doctrine of the Trinity, which was also ac- cording to Philo Judreus the doctrine of the Jews before Christ- this handful of Priestleians should take on themselves to deny it, etc., etc. He was very sorry that Dr. Channing, a man to whorr~ he looked up-no, to say that he looked up to him would be to. speak falsely, but a man whom he looked at with so lnuch in ... terest-should elTlbrace such views. When he saw Dr. Channing he had hinted to him that he was afraid he loved Christianity for what was lovely and excellent-he loved the good in it, and not the true-\"And I tell you, sir, that I have known ten per- sons who loved the good, for one person who loved the true; but it is a far greater virtue to love the true for itself alone, than to love the good for itself alone.\" fIe (Coleridge) knew all about Unitarianism perfectly well, because he had once been a Uni- tarian and knew what quackery it was. He had been called \"the ENGLISH TRAITS rising star of Unitarianism.\" He went on defining, or rather refining: \"The Trinitarian doctrine was realism; the idea of God was not essential, but super-essential;\" talked of trinism and tetrakism and much more, of which I only caught this, \"that the will was that by which a person is a person; because, if one should push me in the street, and", "\"The Trinitarian doctrine was realism; the idea of God was not essential, but super-essential;\" talked of trinism and tetrakism and much more, of which I only caught this, \"that the will was that by which a person is a person; because, if one should push me in the street, and so I should force the man next me into the kennel, I should at once exclaim, I did not do it, sir, meaning it was not my will.\" And this also, that \"if you should insist on your faith here in England, and I on mine, mine would be the hotter side of the fagot.\" I took advantage of a pause to say that he had many readers of all religious opinions in America, and I proceeded to inquire if the \"extract\" from the Independent's pamphlet, in the third volume of the Friend, were a veritable quotation. He replied that it was really taken from a pamphlet in his possession entitled \"A Protest of one of the Independents,\" or something to that effect. I told him how excellent I thought it and how much I wished to see the entire work. (cYes,\" he said, \"the man was a chaos of truths, but lacked the knowledge that God was a God of order. Yet the passage would no doubt strike you more in the quotation than in the original, for I have filtered it.\" When I rose to go, he said, \"1 do not know whether you care about poetry, but I will repeat some verses I lately made on my baptismal anniversary,\" and he recited with strong emphasis, standing, ten or twelve lines beginning- \"Born unto God in Christ \" He inquired where I had been travelling; and on learning that I had been in Malta and Sicily, he compared", "I will repeat some verses I lately made on my baptismal anniversary,\" and he recited with strong emphasis, standing, ten or twelve lines beginning- \"Born unto God in Christ \" He inquired where I had been travelling; and on learning that I had been in Malta and Sicily, he compared one island with the other, repeating what he had said to the Bishop of London when he returned from that country, that Sicily was an excellent school of political economy; for, in any town there, it only needed to ask what the government enacted, and reverse that, to know what ought to be done; it was the most felicitously opposite legisla .. tion to anything good and wise. There were only three things which the government had brought into that garden of delights, ENGLISH TRAITS namely, itch, pox and famine. Whereas in Malta, the force of law and mind was seen, in making that barren rock of semi .. Saracen inhabitants the seat of popUlation and plenty. Going out, he showed me in the next apartment a picture of Allston's,. and told me that Montague, a picture-dealer, once came to see him, and glancing towards tbis, said, \"Well, you have got a pic- ture! \" thinking it the work of an old master; afterwards, Mon ... tague, still talking with his back to the canvas, put up his hand and touched it, and exclaimed, \"By Heaven! this picture is not ten years old: \"-so delicate and skilful was that man's touch.

I was in his cOlnpany for about an hour, but find it impossible to recall the largest part of his discourse, which was often like so many printed paragraphs in his book-perhaps the same- so readily did he fall into certain commonplaces. As I might have foreseen, the visit was rather a spectacle than a conversation, of no use beyond the satisfaction of my curiosity. He was old and preoccupied, and could not bend to a new companion and think with him. From Edinburgh I went to the Highlands. On my return I came from Glasgow to Dumfries, and being intent on delivering a letter which I had brought from Rome, inquired for Craigen ... puttock. It was a farm in Nithsdale, in the parish of Dunscore, sixteen miles distant. No public coach passed near it, so I took a private carriage from the inn. I found the house amid desolate heathery hills, where the lonely scholar nourished his mighty heart. Carlyle was a man from his youth, an author who did not need to hide from his readers, and as absolute a man of the world, unknown and exiled on that hill-farm, as if holding on his own terms what is best in London. He was tall and gaunt, with a cliff-like brow, self-possessed and holding his extraordinary powers of conversation in easy command; clinging to his north- ern accent with evident relish; full of lively anecdote and. with a streaming hun10r which floated every thing he looked upon. His talk playfully exalting the familiar objects, put the com- panion at once into an acquaintance with his Lars and Lemurs, and it was very pleasant to learn what was predestined to be a 53 0 ENGLISH TRAITS pretty mythology. Few were the objects and lonely the man; \"not", "upon. His talk playfully exalting the familiar objects, put the com- panion at once into an acquaintance with his Lars and Lemurs, and it was very pleasant to learn what was predestined to be a 53 0 ENGLISH TRAITS pretty mythology. Few were the objects and lonely the man; \"not a person to speak to within sixteen miles except the min- ister of Dunscore;\" so that books inevitably made his topics. He had names of his own for all the matters familiar to his discourse. Blackwood's was the \"sand magazine;\" Fraser's nearer approach to possibility of life was the \"mud magazine;\" a piece of road near by, that marked some failed enterprise, was the \"grave of the last sixpence.\" When too much praise of any genius annoyed him he professed hugely to admire the talent shown by his pig. He had spent much time and contrivance in confining the poor beast to one enclosure in his pen, but pig, by great strokes of judgment, had found out how to let a board down, and had foiled him. For all that he still thought man the most plastic little fellow in the planet, and he liked Nero's death, \"Qualis artifex pereo I\" better than most history. He worships a man that will manifest any truth to him. At one time he had inquired and read a good deal about America. Landor's prin- ciple was mere rebellion; and that he feared was the American principle. The best thing he knew of that country was that in it a man can have meat for his labor. He had read in Stewart's book that when he inquired in a New York hotel for the Boots, he had been shown across the street and had found Mungo in his own house dining on roast turkey.", "country was that in it a man can have meat for his labor. He had read in Stewart's book that when he inquired in a New York hotel for the Boots, he had been shown across the street and had found Mungo in his own house dining on roast turkey. We talked of books. Plato he does not read, and he disparaged Socrates; and, when pressed, persisted in making Mirabeau a hero. Gibbon he called the \"splendid bridge from the old world to the new.\" His own reading had been multifarious. Tristram Shandy was one of his first books after Robinson Crusoe, and Robertson's America an early favorite. Rousseau's Confessions had discovered to him that he was not a dunce; and it was now ten years since he had learned German, by the advice of a man who told him he would find in that language what he wanted. He took despairing or satirical views of literature at this mo- ment; recounted the incredible sums paid in one year by the great booksellers for puffing. Hence it comes that no newspaper is trusted now, no books are bought, and the booksellers are on the eve of bankruptcy.

They burned the stacks and so found a way to force the rich people to attend to them. We went out to walk over long hills, and looked at Crifiel, then without his cap, and down into Wordsworth's country. There we sat down and talked of the immortality of the souL It was not Carlyle's fault that we talked on that topic, for he had the nat- ural disinclination of every nimble spirit to bruise itself against walls, and did not like to place himself where no step can be taken. But he was honest and true, and cognizant of the subtile links that bind ages together, and saw how every event affects all the future. \"Christ died on the tree; that built Dunscore kirk yonder; that brought you and me together. Time has only a relative existence.\" He was already turning his eyes towards London with a schol- ar's appreciation. London is the heart of the world, he said, won- derful only from the mass of human beings. He liked the huge machine. Each keeps its own round. The baker's boy brings muffins to the window at a fixed hour every day, and that is all the Londoner knows or wishes to know on the subject. But it turned out good men. He named certain individuals, especially one man of letters, his friend, the best mind he knew, whom London had well served. On the 28th August I went to Rydal JYlount, to pay my reo. spects to Mr. Wordsworth. His daughters called in their father, a plain, elderly,", "out good men.

On the 28th August I went to Rydal JYlount, to pay my reo. spects to Mr. Wordsworth. His daughters called in their father, a plain, elderly, white-haired man, not prepossessing, and dis- figured by green goggles. He sat down, and talked with great simplicity. He had just returned ,from a journey. His health was good, but he had broken a tooth by a fall, when walking with t.wo lawyers, and had said that he was glad it did not happen 532 ENGLISH TRAITS forty years ago; whereupon they had praised his philosophy. He had much to say of America, the more that it gave occa- sion for his favorite topic-that society is being enlightened by a superficial tuition, out of all proportion to its being restrained by moral culture. Schools do no good. Tuition is not education. He thinks more of the education of circumstances than of tuition. 'T is not question whether there are offences of which the law takes cognizance, but whether there are offences of which the law does not take cognizance. Sin is what he fears-and how society is to escape without gravest mischiefs from this source. He has even said, what seemed a paradox, that they needed a civil war in America, to teach the necessity of knitting the social ties stronger. \"There may be,\" he said, \"in America some vulgarity in manner, but that's not important. That comes of the pioneer state of things. But I fear they are tno much given to the making of money; and secondly, to politics; that they make political distinction the end and not the means.

But I fear they are tno much given to the making of money; and secondly, to politics; that they make political distinction the end and not the means. And I fear they lack. a class of men of leisure-in short, of gentlemen-to give a tone of honor to the community. I am told that things are boasted of in the second class of society there, which, in Eng- land-God knows, are done in England every day, but would never be spoken of. In America I wish to know not how many churches or schools, but what newspapers? lVly friend Colonel Hamilton, at the foot of the hill, who was a year in America, assures me that the newspapers are atrocious, and accuse mem- bers of Congress of stealing spoons I \" He was against taking off the tax on newspapers in England-which the reformers repre- sent as a tax upon knowledge-for this reason, that they would be inundated with base prints. He said he talked on political aspects, for he wished to impress on me and all good Americans to cultivate the moral, the conservative, etc., etc., and never to call into action the physical strength of the people, as had just now been done in England in the Reform Bill-a thing prophe- sied by Delolme. He alluded once or twice to his conversation with Dr. Cha.nning, who had recently visited him (laying his hand on a particular chair in which the Doctor had sat). The conversation turned OD books.

Lucretius he esteems a far ENGLISH TRAITS 533 bigher poet than Virgil; not in his system, which is nothing, but in his power of illustration. Faith is necessary to explain any ... thing and to reconcile the foreknowledge of God with human evil. Of Cousin (whose lectures we had all been reading in Boston), he knew only the name. I inquired if he had read Carlyle's critical articles and trans ... lations. He said he thought him sometimes insane. He proceeded to abuse Goethe's Wilhelm Meister heartily. It was full of all maDner of fornication. It was like the crossing of flies in the air. He had never gone farther than the first part; so disgusted was he that he threw the book across the room. I deprecated this wrath, and said what I could for the better parts of the book, and he courteously promised to look at it again. Carlyle he said wrote most obscurely. He was clever and deep, but he defied the sympathies of every body. Even Mr. Coleridge wrote more clearly, though he had always wished Coleridge would write more to be understood. He led me out into his garden, and showed me the gravel walk in which thousands of his lines were com- posed. His eyes are much inflamed. This is no loss except for reading, because he never writes prose, and of poetry he car- ries even hundreds of lines in his head before writing them .. He had just returned from a visit to Staffa, and within three days had made three sonnets on Fingal's Cave, and was composing a fourth when he was called in to see me. He said, \"If you are in- terested in my", "lines in his head before writing them ..

He said, \"If you are in- terested in my verses perhaps you willHIte to hear these lines.\" I gladly assented, and he recollected himself for a few momC!nts and then stood forth and repeated, one after the other, the three entire sonnets with great animation. I fancied the second and third more beautiful than his poems are wont to be. The third is addressed to the flowers, which, he said, especially the ox ... eye daisy, are very abundant on the top of the rock. The second al ... ludes to the name of the cave, which is \"Cave of Music;\" the first to the circumstance of its being visited by the promiscuous company of the steamboat .. This recitation was so unlooked for and surprising-he, the old Wordsworth, standing apart, and reciting to me in a garden-walk, like a school-boy declaiming-that I at first was near to laugh; 534 ENGLISH TRAITS but recollecting myself, that I had come thus far to see a poet and he was chanting poems to me, I saw that he was right and I was wrong, and gladly gave myself up to hear. I told him how much the few printed extracts had quickened the desire to pos .. sess his unpublished poems. He replied he never was in haste to publish; partly because he corrected a good deal, and every alteration is ungraciously received after printing; but what he had writteil would be printed, whether he lived or died.

I said Tintern Abbey appeared to be the favorite poem with the public, but more contemplative readers preferred the first books of the Excursion, and the Sonnets. He said, \"Yes, they are better.\" He preferred such of his poems as touched the affections, to any others; for whatever is didactic-what theories of society, and so on-might perish quickly; but whatever combined a truth with an affection was 'X.ril'~la e~ dEL, good to-day and good for .. ever. He cited the sonnet, On the feelings of a highminded Span- iard, which he preferred to any other (1 so understood him), and the Two Voices; and quoted, with evident pleasure, the verses addressed To the Skylark. In this connection he said of the Newtonian theory that it might yet be superseded and for- gotten; and Dalton's atomic theory. When I prepared to depart he said he wished to show me what a common person in England could do, and he led me into the enclosure of his clerk, a young man to whom he had given this slip of ground, which was laid out, or its natu\".d.l capabilities shown, with much taste. He then said he would show me a better way towards the inn; and he walked a good part of a mile, talking and ever and anon stopping short to impress the word or the verse, and finally parted tram me with great kindness and re- turned across the fields. Wordsworth honored himself by his simple adherence to truth, and was very willing not to shine; but he surprised by the hard limits", "and ever and anon stopping short to impress the word or the verse, and finally parted tram me with great kindness and re- turned across the fields. Wordsworth honored himself by his simple adherence to truth, and was very willing not to shine; but he surprised by the hard limits of his thought. To judge from a single conversation, he made the impression of a narrow and very English mind; of one who paid for his rare elevation by general tameness and con- formity. Off his own beat, his opinions were of no value. It is not very rare to find persons loving sympathy and ease, who ENGLISH TRAITS 535 expiate their departure from the common in one direction, by their conformity in every other. CHAPTER II VOYAGE TO ENGLAND THE occasion of my second visit to England was an invitation from some Mechanics' Institutes in Lancashire and Yorkshire, which separately are organized much in the same way as our New England Lyceums, but in I847 had been linked into a \"Union,\" which embraced twenty or thirty towns and cities and presently extended into the middle counties and northward into Scotland. I was invited, on liberal terms, to read a series of lec- tures in them all. The request was urged with every kind sugges .. tion and every assurance of aid and comfort, by friendliest parties in Manchester, who, in the sequel, amply redeemed their word. The remuneration was equivalent to the fees at that time paid in this country for the like services. At all events it was sufficient to cover any travelling expenses, and the proposal offered an excellent opportunity of seeing the interior of England and Scot- land, by means of a home and a committee of intelligent friends awaiting me in every town. I did", "country for the like services. At all events it was sufficient to cover any travelling expenses, and the proposal offered an excellent opportunity of seeing the interior of England and Scot- land, by means of a home and a committee of intelligent friends awaiting me in every town. I did not go very willingly. I am not a good traveller, nor havE.: I found that long journeys yield a fair share of reasonable hours. But the invitation was repeated and pressed at a moment of more leisure and when I was a little spent by some unusual studies, I wanted a change and a tonic, and England was proposed to me, Besides, there were at least the dread attraction and salutary in\u00b7 fluences of the sea. So I took my berth in the packet-ship Wash, ington Irving and sailed from Boston, Tuesday, October 5, 1847 .. On Friday at noon we bad only made one hundred and thirty\" four miles. A nimble Indian would have swum as far; but the captain affirmed that the ship would show us in time all her paces,.and ,ve crept along through the floating drift of boards, logs and chips, which the rivers of Maine and New Brunswick pour into the sea after a freshet. ENGLISH TRAITS At last, on Sunday night, after doing one day's work in four, the storm came, the winds blew, and we flew before a north- wester which strained every rope and sail. The good ship darts ~hrough the water all day, all night, like a fish; quivering with ~peed, gliding through liquid leagues, sliding from horizon to horizon.

She has passed Cape Sable; she has reached the Banks; the land ... birds are left; gulls, haglets, ducks, petrels, swim, dive and hover around; no fishermen; she bas passed the Banks, left five sail behind her far on the edge of the west at sundown, which were far east of us at morn-though they say at sea a stem chase is a long race-and still we fly for our lives. The shortest sea .. line from Boston to Liverpool is 2850 miles. This a steamer keeps, and saves ISO miles. A sailing ship can never go in a shorter line than 3000, and usually it is much longer. Our good master keeps his kites up to the last moment, studding- sails alow and aloft, and by incessant straight steering, never loses a rod of way. Watchfulness is the law of the ship-watch on watch, for advantage and for life. Since the ship was built, it seems, the master never slept but in his day-clothes whilst on board. \"There are many advantages,\" says Saadi, \"in sea-voy- aging, but security is not one of them.\" Yet in hurrying over these abysses, whatever dangers we are running into, we are certainly running out of the risks of hundreds of miles every day, which have their own chances of squall, collision, sea-stroke, piracy, cold and thunder. Hour for hour, the risk on a steamboat is greater; but the speed is safety, or twelve days of danger in- stead of twenty-four. Our ship was registered 750 tons, and weighed perhaps, with all her freight, 1500 tons. The mainmast, from the deck to the top-button, measured I 15 feet; the length of the deck from stem", "is greater; but the speed is safety, or twelve days of danger in- stead of twenty-four. Our ship was registered 750 tons, and weighed perhaps, with all her freight, 1500 tons. The mainmast, from the deck to the top-button, measured I 15 feet; the length of the deck from stem to stem, 155. It is impossible not to personify a ship ~ every body does, in every thing they say-she behaves well; she minds her rudder; she swims like a duck; she runs her nose into the water; she looks into a port. Then that wonderful esprit de corps by which we adopt into our self-love every thing we touch, makes us all champions of her sailing qualities. The conscious ship hears all the praise. In one week she has ENGLISH TRAITS 537 made 1467 miles, and now, at night, seems to hear the stearnel behind her, which left Boston to-day at two; has mended her speed and is flying before the gray south wind eleven and a half knots the hour. The sea-fire shines in her wake and far around wherever a wave breaks. I read the hour, 9h. 45', on my watch by this light. Near the equator you can read small print by it; and the mate describes the phosphoric insects, when taken up in a pail, as shaped like a Carolina potato. I find the sea-life an acquired taste, like that for tomatoes and olives. The confinement, cold, motion, noise and odor are not to be dispensed with. The floor of your room is sloped at an angle of twenty or thirty degrees, and I waked every morning with the belief that some one was tipping up nly berth. Nobody likes to be treated ignominiously, upset, shoved against the side of the house, rolled over, suffocated", "dispensed with. The floor of your room is sloped at an angle of twenty or thirty degrees, and I waked every morning with the belief that some one was tipping up nly berth. Nobody likes to be treated ignominiously, upset, shoved against the side of the house, rolled over, suffocated with bilge, mephitis and stewing oil. We get used to these annoyances at last, but the dread of the sea remains longer. The sea is masculine, the type of active strength. Look, what egg-shells are drifting allover it, each one, like ours, filled with men in ecstasies of terror, alternating with cockney conceit, as the sea is rough or smooth. Is this sad- colored circle an eternal cemetery? In our graveyards we scoop a pit, but this aggressive water opens mile-wide pits and chasms and makes a mouthful of a fleet. To the geologist the sea is the only firmament; the land is in perpetual flux and change, now blown up like a tumor, now sunk in a chasm, and the registered observations of a few hundred years find it in a perpetual tilt, rising and falling. The sea keeps its old level; and 't is no wonder that the history of our race is so recent, if the roar of the ocean is silencinp; our traditions. A rising of the sea, such as has been ob ... served, sayan inch in a century, from east to west on the land, will bury all the towns, monuments, bones and knowledge of mankind, steadily and insensibly. If it is capable of these great and secular mischiefs, it is quite as ready at private and local damage; and of this no landsman seems so fearful as the seaman. Such discomfort and such danger as the narratives of the captain and mate disclose", "of mankind, steadily and insensibly. If it is capable of these great and secular mischiefs, it is quite as ready at private and local damage; and of this no landsman seems so fearful as the seaman. Such discomfort and such danger as the narratives of the captain and mate disclose are bad enough as the costly fee we pay for entrance to Europe; but the wonder is always new that any sane 538 ENGLISH TRAITS man can be a sailor. And here on the second day of our voyage, stepped out a little boy in his shirt-sleeves, who had hid himself whilst the ship was in port, in the bread-closet, having no money and wishing to go to England. The sailors have dressed him in Guernsey frock, with a knife in his belt, and he is climbing nimbly about after them ;-\"likes the work first-rate, and if the captain will take him, means now to come back again in the ship .. \" The mate avers that this is the history of all sailors; nine out of ten are runaway boys; and adds that all of them are sick of the sea, but stay in it out of pride. Jack has a life of risks, in- cessant abuse and the worst pay. It is a little better with the mate and not very much better with the captain. A hundred dollars a month is reckoned high pay. If sailors were contented, if they had not resolved again and again not to go to sea any more, I should respect them. Of course the inconveniences and terrors of the sea are not of any account to those whose minds are preoccupied.

Of course the inconveniences and terrors of the sea are not of any account to those whose minds are preoccupied. The water- laws, arctic frost, the mountain, the mine, only shatter cockney- ~sm; every noble activity makes room for itself. A great mind is a good sailor, as a great heart is. And the sea is not slow in dis- closing inestimable secrets to a good naturalist. 'T is a good rule in every journey to provide some piece of liberal study to rescue the hours which bad weather, bad com- pany and taverns steal from the best economist. Classics which at home are drowsily read, have a strange charm in a country inn, or in the transom of a merchant brig. I remember that some of the happiest and most valuable hours I have owed to books, passed, many years ago, on shipboard. The worst impediment I have found at sea is the want of light in the cabin. We found on board the usual cabin library; Basil Hall, Dumas, Dickens, Bulwer, Balzac and Sand were our sea-gods. Among the passengers there was some variety of talent and profession; we exchanged our experiences and a.lliearned something. The busiest talk with leisure and convenience at sea, and sometimes a mem- orable fact turns up, which you have long had a vacant niche for, and seize with the joy of a collector. But, under the best . conditions, a voyage is one of the severest test~. to try a man. ENGLISH TRAITS 539 A college examination is nothing to it.

Sea-days are long-these lack-lustre, joyless days which whistled over us; but they were few-only fifteen, as the captain counted, sixteen according to me. Reckoned from the time when we left soundings, our speed was such that the captain drew the line of his course in red ink on his chart, for the encouragement or envy of future navi ... gators. It has been said that the King of England would consult his dignity by giving audience to foreign ambassadors in the cabin of a man-of-war. And I think the white path of an Atlantic ship the right avenue to the palace front of this seafaring people, who for hundreds of years claimed the strict sovereignty of the sea, and exacted toll and the striking sail from the ships of all other peoples. \\~rhen. their privilege was disputed by the Dutch and other junior marines, on the plea that you could never anchor on the same wave, or hold property in what was always flowing, the English did not stick to claim the channel, or bottom of all the main: \"As if,\" said they, \"we contended for the drops of the sea, and not for its situation, or the bed of those waters .. The sea is bounded by his majesty's empire.\" As we neared the land, its genius was felt. This was inevitably the British side. In every man's thought arises now a new system, English sentiments, English loves and fears, English history and social modes. Yesterday every passenger had measured the speed of the ship by watching tne bubbles over the ship's bulwarks. To-day, instead of bubbles, we measure by Kinsale, Cork, Water .. ford and Ardnlore.

There lay thp green shore of Ireland, like some coast of plenty. We could see towns, towers, churches, harvests; but the curse of eight hundred years we could not discern. CHAPTER III LAND ALFIERI thought Italy and England the only countries worth living in; the former because there Nature vindicates her rights 540 ENGLISH TRAITS and triumphs over the evils inflicted by the governments; the latter because art conquers nature and transforms a rude, un- genial land into a paradise of comfort and plenty. England is a garden. Under an ash-colored sky, the fields have been combed and rolled till they appear to have been finished with a pencil instead of a plough. The solidity of the structures that compose the towns speaks the industry of ages. Nothing is left as it was made. Rivers, hills, valleys, the sea itself, feel the hand of a master. The long habitation of a powerful and ingenious race has turned every rood of land to its best use, has found all the capabilities, the arable soil, the quarriable rock, the highways, the byways, the fords, the navigable waters; and the new arts of intercourse meet you every where; so that England is a huge . phalanstery, where all that man wants is provided within the precinct. Cushioned and comforted in every manner, the traveller rides as on a cannon-ball, high and low, over rivers and towns, through mountains in tunnels of three or four miles, at near twice the speed of our trains; and reads quietly", "where all that man wants is provided within the precinct. Cushioned and comforted in every manner, the traveller rides as on a cannon-ball, high and low, over rivers and towns, through mountains in tunnels of three or four miles, at near twice the speed of our trains; and reads quietly the Times newspaper, which, by its immense correspondence and reporting seems to have machinized the rest of the world for his occasion. The problem of the traveller landing at Liverpool is, Why En,gland is England? What are the elements of that power which the English hold over other nations? If there be one test of national genius universally accepted, it is success; and if there be one successful country in the universe for the last millennium, that country is England. A wise traveller will naturally choose to visit the best of actual nations; and ali American has more reasons than another to draw him to Britain. In all that is done or begun by the Americans towards right thinking or practice, we are met by a civilization already settled and overpowering. The culture of the day, the thoughts and aims of men, are English thoughts and aims. A nation considerable for a thousand years since Egbert, it has, in the last centuries, obtained the ascendent, and stamped the knowledge, activity and power of mankind with its impress. Those who resist it do not feel it or obey it less. The Russian in his snows is aiming to be English. The Turk and Chinese alsc ENGLISH TRAITS 541 are making awkward efforts to be English.

The practical com- mon-sense of modern society, the utilitarian direction which labor, laws, opinion, religion take, is the natural genius of the British mind. The influence of France is a constituent of mod- ern civility, but not enough opposed to the English for the most wholesome effect. The American is only the continuation of the English genius into new conditions, more or less propitious. See what books fill our libraries. Every book we read, every biography, play, romance, in whatever form, is still English his- tory and manners. So that a sensible Englishman once said to me, \"As long as you do not grant us copyright, we shall have the teaching of you.\" But we have the same difficulty in making a social or moral estimate of England, that the sheriff finds in drawing a jury to try some cause which has agitated the whole community and on which every body finds himself an interested party. Officers, jurors, judges have all taken sides. England has inoculated all nations with her civilization, intelligence and tastes; and to re .. sist the tyranny and prepossession of the British element, a seri ... ous man must aid himself by comparing with it the civilizations of the farthest east and west, the old Greek, the Oriental, and, much more, the ideal standard; if only by means of the very im- patience which English forms are sure to awaken in independent minds.

Besides, if we will visit London, the present time is the best time, as some signs portend that it has reached its highest point. It is observed that the English interest us a little less within a few years; and hence the impression that the British power has culminated, is in solstice, or already declining. As soon as you enter England, which, with Wales, is no larger than the State of Georgia, this little land stretches by an illusion to the dimensions of an empire. Add South Carolina, and you have more than an equivalent for the area of Scotland. The in- numerable details, the crowded succession of towns, cities, cathe- drals, castles and great and decorated estates, the number and power of the trades and guilds, the military strength and splen~ dor, the multitudes of rich and of remarkable people, the servants 542 ENGLISH TRAITS and equipages-all these catching the eye and never allowing it to pause, hide all boundaries by the impression of magnifi .. cence and endless wealth. I reply to all the urgencies that refer me to this and that ob~ ject indispensably to be seen-Yes, to see England well needs a hundred years; for what they told me was the merit of Sir John Soane's l\\1useum, in London-that it was well packed and well saved-is the merit of England-it is stuffed full, in all corners and crevices, with towns, towers, churches, villas, palaces, hospi~ tals and charity~houses.

Here is no winter, but such days as we have in Massachusetts in November, a temperature which makes no exhausting demand on human strength, but allows the attainment of the largest stature .. Charles the Second said, \"It invited men abroad more days in the year and more hours in the day than another country .. \" Then England has all the materials of a working country except wood. The constant rain-a rain with every tide, in some parts of the island-keeps its multitude of rivers full and brings agricultural production up to the highest point. It has plenty of water, of stone, of potter's clay, of coal, of salt and of iron. The land naturally abounds with game; immense heaths and downs are paved with quails, grouse and woodcock.l and the shores are ani- n1ated by water-birds. The rivers and the surrounding sea spawn 'flith fish; there are salmon for the rich and sprats and her- rings for the poor. In the northern lochs, the herring are in in- numerable shoals; at one season, the country people say, the lakes contain one part water and two parts fish.

The London fog aggravates the distempers of the sky, and sometimes justifies the epigram on the climate by an English wit, \"in a fine day, looking up a chimney; in a foul day, looking down one.\" A gentleman in Liverpool told me that he found he could do without a fire in his parlor about one day in the year. It is however pretended that the enormous consumption of coal in the island is also felt in modifying the general climate. Factitious climate, factitious position. England resembles a ship in its shape, and if it were one, its best admiral could not have worked it or anchored it in a more judicious or effective posi ... tion. Sir John Herschel said, \"London is the centre of the ter- rene globe.\" The shopkeeping nation, to use a shop word, has a. good stand .. The old Venetians pleased themselves with the flat- tery that Venice was in 45 0 , midway between the poles and the line; as if that were an imperial centrality.

I have seen a kratometric chart de .. signed to show that the city of Philadelphia was in the same thermic belt, and by inference in the same belt of empire, as the cities of Athens, Rome and London. It was drawn by a patrioti<: Philadelphian, and was examined with pleasure, under his show\", ing, by the inhabitants of Chestnut Street. But when carried te Charleston, to New Orleans and to Boston, it somehow failed to convince the ingenious scholars of all those capitals. But England is anchored at the side of Europe, and right in the heart of the modern world. The sea, which, according to' Virgil's famous line, divided the poor Britons utterly from the world, proved to be the ring of marriage with all nations .. It is not down in the books-it is written only in the geologic strata--' that fortunate day when a wave of the German Ocean burst the old isthmus which joined Kent and Cornwall to France, and gave to this fragment of Europe its impregnable sea-wall, cuto/ ting off an island of eight hundred miles in length, with an ir- regular breadth reaching to three hundred miles; a territory large 544 ENGLISH TRAITS enough for independence, enriched with every seed of national power, so near that it can see the harvests of the continent, and so far that who would cross the strait must be an expert mariner, ready for tempests.

As America, Europe and Asia lie, these Brit- ons have precisely the best commercial position in the whole planet, and are sure of a market for aU the goods they can manufacture. And to make these advantages avail, the river Thames must dig its spacious outlet to the sea from the heart of the kingdom, giving road and landing to innumerable ships, and all the conveniency to trade that a people so skilful and suffi- cient in economizing water-front by docks, warehouses and light- ers required. When James the First declared his purpose of pun- ishing London by removing his Court, the Lord Mayor replied that \"in removing his royal presence from his lieges, they hoped he would leave them the Thames.\" In the variety of surface, Britain is a miniature of Europe, having plain, forest, marsh, river, seashore, mines in Cornwall; caves in Matlock and Derbyshire; delicious iandscape in Dove- dale, delicious sea .. view at Tor Bay, Highlands in Scotland, Snow- don in Wales, and in Westmoreland and Cumberland a pocket Switzerland, in which the lakes and mountains are on a sufficient scale to fill the eye and touch the imagination. It is a nation conveniently small. Fontenelle thought that nature had some- times a little affectation; and there is such an artificial com ... pleteness in this nation of artificers as if there were a desigD from the beginning to elaborate a bigger Birmingham.

With its fruits, and wares, and money, must its civil influ- ence radiate. It is a singular coincidence to this geDgraphic cen .. trality, the spiritual centrality which Emanuel Swedenborg ascribes to the people. \"For the English nation, the best of them are in the centre of all Christians, bE:.cause they have interior intellectual light. This appears conspicuously in the spiritual world. This light they derive from the liberty of speaking and writing, and thereby of thinking.\" CHAPTER IV RACE AN INGENIOUS anatomist has written a book to prove that races are imperishable, but nations are pliant political constructions, easily changed or destroyed. But this writer did not found his assumed races on any necessary law, disclosing their ideal 01 metaphysical necessity; nor did he on the other hand count witb precision the existing races and settle the true bounds; a point of nicety,", "nations are pliant political constructions, easily changed or destroyed. But this writer did not found his assumed races on any necessary law, disclosing their ideal 01 metaphysical necessity; nor did he on the other hand count witb precision the existing races and settle the true bounds; a point of nicety, and the popular test of the theory. The individuals at the extremes of divergence in one race of men are as unlike as the wolf to the lapdog. Yet each variety shades down imper .. ceptibly into the next, and you cannot draw the line where a race begins or ends. Hence every writer makes a different count Blumenbach reckons five races; Humboldt three; and Mr. Pick- ering, who lately in our Exploring Expedition thinks he sawall the kinds of men that can be on the planet, makes eleven. The British Empire is reckoned to contain (in 1848) 222,- 000,000 souls-perhaps a fifth of the population of the globe; and to comprise a territory of 5,000,000 square miles. So far have British people predominated. Perhaps forty of these millions are of British stock. Add the United States of America, which reckon (in the same year), exclusive of slaves, 20,000,000 of peorle, on a territory of 3,000,000 square miles, and in which the foreig~ ENGLISH TRAITS element, however considerable, is rapidly assimilated, and you have a population of English descent and language of 60,000,000, and governing a population of 245,000,000 souls. The Briti&h census proper reckons twenty-seven and a half millions in the home countries. What makes this census impor- tant is the quality of the upits that compose it. They are free forcible men, in a country where life is safe and has reached the greatest value. They give the bias to the current age; and that, not by chance", "in the home countries. What makes this census impor- tant is the quality of the upits that compose it. They are free forcible men, in a country where life is safe and has reached the greatest value. They give the bias to the current age; and that, not by chance or by mass, but by their character and by the number of individuals among them of personal ability. It has been denied that the English have genius. Be it as it may, men of vast intellect have been born on their soil, and they have made or applied the principal inventions. They have sound bodies and supreme endurance in war and in labor. The spawning force of the race has sufficed to the colonization of great parts of the world; yet it remains to be seen whether they can nlake good the exodus of millions from Great Britain, amounting in I852 to more than a thousand a day. They have assimilating force, since they are imitated by their foreign subjects; and they are still aggressive and propagandist, enlarging the dominion of their arts and liberty. Their laws are hospitable, and ~lavery does not exist under them. What oppression exists is incidental and temporary; their success is not sudden or fortunate, but they have maintained ~onstancy and self .. equality for many ages. Is this power due to their race, or to some other cause? Men hear gladly of the power of blood or race. Every body likes to know that his advantages cannot be attributed to air, soil, sea, or to local wealth, as mines and quarries, nor to laws and tradi- tions, nor to fortune; but to superior brain, as it makes the praise more personal to him. We anticipate in the doctrine of race something like that law", "his advantages cannot be attributed to air, soil, sea, or to local wealth, as mines and quarries, nor to laws and tradi- tions, nor to fortune; but to superior brain, as it makes the praise more personal to him. We anticipate in the doctrine of race something like that law of physiology that whatever bone, muscle, or essential organ is found in one healthy individual, the same part or Jrgan may be found in or near the same place in its congener; and we look to find in the son every mental and moral property that existed in the ancestor. In race, it is not the broad shoulders, or litheness, or -ltature that give advantage, but a symmetry that reaches as far ENGLISH TRAITS 547 as to the wit. Then the miracle and renown begin. Then first we care to examine the pedigree, and copy heedfully the training -what food they ate, what nursing, school, and exercises they had, \"vhich resulted in this mother-wit, delicacy of thought and robust wisdom. How came such men as King Alfred, and Roger Bacon, William of Wykeham, Walter Raleigh, Philip Sidney, Isaac Newton, William Shakspeare, George Chapman, Francis Bacon, George Herbert, Henry Vane, to exist here? What made. these delicate natures? was it the air? was it the sea? was it the parentage? For it is certain that these men are samples of their contemporaries. The hearing ear is always found close to the speaking tongue, and no genius can long or often utter any thing which is not invited and gladly entertained by men around him. It is race, is it not, that puts the hundred millions of India under the dominion of a remote island in the north of Europe? Race avails much, if that be true which is alleged, that all", "any thing which is not invited and gladly entertained by men around him. It is race, is it not, that puts the hundred millions of India under the dominion of a remote island in the north of Europe? Race avails much, if that be true which is alleged, that all Celts are Catholics and all Saxons are Protestants; that Celts love unity of power, and Sa\"Cons the\\ representative principle. Race is a controlling influence in the Jew, who, for two millenniums, under every climate, has preserved the same character and em ... ployments. Race in the negro is of appalling importance. The French in Canada, cut off fronl all intercourse with the parent people, have held their national traits. I chanced to read Tacitus On the Manners of the Germans, not long since, in Missouri and the heart of Illinois, and I found abundant points of resem- blance between the Germans of the Hercynian forest, and our Hoosiers, Suckel's and Badgers of the American woods. But whilst race works immortally to keep its own, it is re ... sisted by other forces. Civilization is a re-agent, and eats away the old traits. The Arabs of to-day are the Arabs of Pharaoh; but the Briton of to .. day is a very different person from Cassibe- launus or Ossian, Each religious sect has its physiognomy. The Methodists haye acquired a face; the Quakers, a face; the nuns~ a face. An Englishman will pick out a dissenter by his manners. Trades and professions carve their own lines on face and form. Certain circumstances of English life are not less effective; as personal liberty; plenty of food; good ale and mutton; open ENGLISH TRAITS market, or good wages for every kind of labor; high bribes to talent and skill; the island life, or", "professions carve their own lines on face and form. Certain circumstances of English life are not less effective; as personal liberty; plenty of food; good ale and mutton; open ENGLISH TRAITS market, or good wages for every kind of labor; high bribes to talent and skill; the island life, or the million opportunities and outlets for expanding and misplaced talent; readiness of com ... bination among themselves for politics or for business; strikes; and sense of superiority founded on habit of victory in labor and in war: and the appetite for superiority grows by feeding. It is easy to add to the counteracting forces to race. Credence is a main element. 'T is said that the views of nature held by any people determine all their institutions. Whatever influences add to mental or moral faculty, take men out of nationality as out of other conditions, and make the national life a culpable com ... . promIse. These limitations of the formidable doctrine of race suggest others which threaten to undermine it, as not sllfficiently based. The fixity or inconvertibleness of races as we see them is a weak argument for the eternity of these frail boundaries, since all our historical period is a point to the duration in which na- ture has wrought. Any the least and solitariest fact in our natural history, such as the melioration of fruits and of animal stocks, has the worth of a power in the opportunity of geologic periods. Moreover, though we flatter the self-love of men and nations by the legend of pure races, all our experience is of the gradation and resolution of races, and strange resemblances meet us everywhere. It need not puzzle us that Malay and Papuan, Celt and Roman, Saxon and Tartar should mix, when we see the rudiments", "self-love of men and nations by the legend of pure races, all our experience is of the gradation and resolution of races, and strange resemblances meet us everywhere. It need not puzzle us that Malay and Papuan, Celt and Roman, Saxon and Tartar should mix, when we see the rudiments of tiger and baboon in our human form, and know that the barriers of races ,are not so firm but that some spray sprinkles us from the antediluvian seas. The low organizations are simplest; a mere mouth, a jelly, or a straight worm. As the scale mounts, the organizations become :omplex. Weare piqued with pure descent, but nature loves in ... )culation. A child blends in his face the faces of both parents md some feature from every ancestor whose face hangs on the wall. The best nations are those most widely related; and navi- ~ation, as effecting a world-wide mixture, is the most potent tdvancer of nations. The English composite character betrays a mixed origin. ENGLISH TRAITS 549 Everything English is a fusion of distant and antagonistic ele- ments. The language is mixed; the names of men are of dif ... ferent nations-three languages, three or four nations-the cur- rents of thought are counter: contemplation and practical skill; active intellect and dead conservatism; world-wide enterprise and devoted use and wont; aggressive freedom and hospitable law with bitter class-legislation; a people scattered by their wars and affairs over the face of the whole earth, and homesick to a man; a country of extremes-dukes and chartists, Bishops of Durham and naked heathen colliers-nothing can be praised in it without damning exceptions, and nothing denounced with- out salvos of cordial praise. Neither do this people appear to be of one stem, but collectively a better race than any from which they are", "country of extremes-dukes and chartists, Bishops of Durham and naked heathen colliers-nothing can be praised in it without damning exceptions, and nothing denounced with- out salvos of cordial praise. Neither do this people appear to be of one stem, but collectively a better race than any from which they are derived. Nor is it easy to trace it home to its original seats. Who can call by right names what races are in Britain? Who can trace them his- torically? Who can discriminate them anatomically, or meta- physically? In the impossibility of arriving at satisfaction on the his- torical question of race, and-come of whatever disputable an\u00b7 cestry-the indisputable Englishman before me, nimself very well marked, and nowhere else to be found-I fancied I could leave quite aside the choice of a tribe as his lineal progenitors. Defoe said in his wrath, \"the Englishman was the mud of all races.\" I incline to the belief that, as water, lime and sand make mortar, so certain temperaments marry well, and, by well-man- aged contrarieties, develop as drastic a character as the English. On the whole it is not so much a history of one or of certain tribes of Saxons, Jutes, or Frisians, coming from one place and genetically identical, as it is an anthology of temperaments out of them all. Certain ten1peranlents suit the sky and soil of Eng- land, say eight or ten or twenty varieties, as, out of a hundred pear-trees, eight or ten suit the soil of an orchard and thrive- whilst all the unadapted temperanlents die out. The English derive their pedigree trom such a range of na ... tionalities that there needs sea-foam and land-room to unfold the varieties of talent and character.

Perhaps the ocean serves a~ S50 ENGLISH TRA!TS a galvanic battery, to distribute acids at one pole and alkalies at the other. So England tends to accumulate her liberals in America and her conservatives at London. The Scandinavians , in her race still hear in every age the murmurs of their mother, the ocean; the Briton in the blood hugs the homestead still. Again, as if to intensate the influences that are not of race, what we think of when we talk of English traits really narrows itself to a small district. It excludes Ireland and Scotland and vVales, and reduces itself at. last to London, that is, to those who come and go thither. The portraits that hang on the walls in the Academy Exhibition at London, the figures in Punch's drawings of the public men or of the club-houses, the prints in the shop .. windows, are distinctive English, and not American, no, nor Scotch, nor Irish: but 't is a very restricted nationality. As you go north into the manufacturing and agricultural districts, and to the population that never travels; ~s Y01:l go into Yorkshire, as you enter Scotland, the world's Englishman is no longer found. In Scotland there is a rapid loss of all grandeur of mien and manners; a provincial eagerness and acuteness appear; the poverty of the country makes itself remarked, and a coarseness of manners; and, among the intellectual, is the insanity of dia- lectics. In Ireland are the same climate and soil as in England, but less food, no right relation to the land,", "manners; a provincial eagerness and acuteness appear; the poverty of the country makes itself remarked, and a coarseness of manners; and, among the intellectual, is the insanity of dia- lectics. In Ireland are the same climate and soil as in England, but less food, no right relation to the land, political dependel'lce, small tenantry and an inferior or misplaced race. These queries concerning ancestry and blood may be well al- lowed, for there is no prosperity that seems more to depend on the kind of man than British prosperity. Only a hardy and wise people could have made this small territory great. We say, in a regatta or yacht-race, that if the boats are anywhere nearly matched, it is the man that wins. Put the best sailing-master into either boat, and he will win. Yet it is fine for us to speculate in face of unbroken traditions, though vague and losing themselves in fable. The traditions have got footing, and refuse to be disturbed. The kitchen-clack is more convenient than sidereal time. We must use the popular category, as we do the Linnrean classification, for convenience, and not as exact and final. Otherwise we are presently confounded when the ENGLISH TRAITS 551 best-settled traits of one race are claimed by SaIne Ilew ethnol.c ogist as precisely characteristic of the rival tribe. I found plenty of well-marked English types, toe ruddy com .. plexion fair and plump, robust men, with faces cut like a die, and a strong island speech and accent; a Norman type, with the complacency that belongs to that constitution. Others who might be Americans, for any thing that appeared in their complexion or form; and their speech was much less marked and their thought much less bound. We will call them Saxons. Then the Roman has implanted", "accent; a Norman type, with the complacency that belongs to that constitution. Others who might be Americans, for any thing that appeared in their complexion or form; and their speech was much less marked and their thought much less bound. We will call them Saxons. Then the Roman has implanted his dark complexion in the trinity 01 quaternity of bloods. I. The sources from which tradition derives their stock are mainly three. And first they are of the oldest blood of the world- the Celtic. Some peoples are deciduous or transitory. Where are the Greeks? Where the Etrurians? Where the Romans? But the Celts or Sidonides are an old family, of whose beginning there is no memory, and their end is likely to be still more remote in the future; for they have endurance and productiveness. They planted Britain, and gave to the seas and mountains names which are poems and imitate the pure voices of nature. They are favor- ably remembered in the oldest records of Europe. They had no violent feudal tenure, but the husband--man owned the land. They had an alphabet, astronomy, priestly culture and a sublime creed. They have a hidden and precarious genius. They made the best popular literature of the Middle Ages in the songs of Merlin and the tender and delicious mythology of Arthur. 2.

Charlemagne, halting one day in a town of Narbonnese Gaul, looked out of a window and saw a fleet of N orthmen cruis- ing in the Mediterranean. They even entered the port of the town where he was, causing no small alarm and sudden manning and arming of his galleys. As they put out to sea again, th~ , ENGLISH TRAITS emperor gazed long after them, his eyes bathed in tears. HI am tormented with sorrow,\" he said, \"when I foresee the evils they will bring on my posterity.\" There was reason for these Xerxes' tears. The men who have built a ship and invented the rig, cordage, sail, compass and pump; the working in and out of port, have acquired much more than a ship. Now arm them and every shore is at their mercy. For if they have not numerical superiority where they anchor, they have only to sail a mile or two to find it. Bonaparte's art of war, namely of concentrating force on the point of attack, must always be theirs who have the choice of the battle-ground. Of course they come into the fight from a higher ground of power than the land -na tions; and can engage them on shore with a victorious advantage in the retreat. As soon as the shores are sufficiently peopled to make piracy a losing business, the same skill and courage are ready for the service of trade. The Heimskringla, or Sagas of the Kings (9f Norway, collected by Snorro Sturleson, is the Iliad and Odyssey of English history. Its portraits, like Homer's, are strongly individualized.

The Heimskringla, or Sagas of the Kings (9f Norway, collected by Snorro Sturleson, is the Iliad and Odyssey of English history. Its portraits, like Homer's, are strongly individualized. The Sagas describe a monarchical republic like Sparta. The govern- ment disappears before the importance of citizens. In Norway, no Persian masses fight and perish to aggrandize a king, but the actors are bonders or landholders, everyone of whom is named and personally and patronymically described, as the king's friend and companion. A sparse population gives this high worth to every man. Individuals are often noticed as very handsome persons, which trait only brings the story nearer to the English race. Then the solid material interest predominates, so dear to English understanding, wherein the association is logical, between merit and land. The heroes of the Sagas are not the knights of South Europe .. No vaporing of France and Spain has corrupted them. They are substantial farmers whom the rough times have forced to defend their properties. They have weapons which they use in a determined manner, by no means for chivalry, but for their acres. They are people con- siderably ~dvanced in rural arts, living amphibiously on a rough c~ast, and drawing half their food from the sea and half from ENGLISH TRAITS 5.53 the land. They have herds of cows, and malt, whea~ .. 1Jacon, but- ter and cheese. They fish in the fiord and hunt the deer.

A king was maintained, much as in some of our country districts a winter-schoolmaster is quar .. tered, a week here, a week there, and a fortnight on the next farm-on all the farms in rotation. This the king calls going in to guest-quarters; and it was the only way in which, in a po~r country, a poor king with many retainers could be kept alive when he leaves his own farm to collect his dues through the kingdom. These Norsemen are excellent persons in the main, with good sense, steadiness, wise speech and prompt action. But they have a singular turn for homicide; their chief end of man is to murder or to be murdered; oars, scythes, harpoons, crowbars, peat- knives and hay-forks are tools valued by them all the mor~ for their charming aptitude for assassinations. A pair of kings, after dinner, will divert themselves by thrusting each his sword thx ougb the other's body, as did Yngve and Alf. Another pair ride out on a morning for a frolic, and finding no weapon near, will take the bits out of their horses' mouths and crush each other's heads with them, as did Alrie and Eric. The sight of a tent-cord 0)' a cloak-string puts them on hanging, somebody, a wife, or a husband, or, best of all, a king. If a farmer has so much as a bay-fork, he sticks it into a King Dag. King Ingiald finds it vastly amusing to burn up half a dozen kings in a hall, after getting them drunk.

King Ingiald finds it vastly amusing to burn up half a dozen kings in a hall, after getting them drunk. Never was poor gentleman so surfeited with life, so furious to be rid of it, as the N orthman. If he cannot pick any other quarrel, he will get himself comfortably gored by a bull's horns, like Egil, or slain by a land-slide, like the agricul- tural King Onulld. Odin died in his bed, in Sweden; but it was a proverb of ill condition to die the death of old age. King Hake of Sweden cuts and slashes in battle, as long as he can stand, then orders his war-ship, loaded with his dead men and their weapons, to be taken out to sea, the tiller shipped and the sails spread; being left alone he sets fire to some tar-wood and lies down contented on deck. The wind blew off the land, the ship 554 ENGLISH TRAITS flew, burning in clear flame, out between the islets into the ocean, and there was the right end of King Hake. The early Sagas are sanguinary and piratical; the later are of a noble strain. History rarely yields us better passages than the conversation between King Sigurd the Crusader and King Eystein his brother, on their respective merits-one the soldier, and the other a lover of the arts of peace. But the reader of the Norman history must steel himself by holding fast the remote compensations which result from animal vigor. As the old fossil world shows that the first steps of reducing the chaos were confided to saurians and other huge and horrible animals, so the foundations of the new civility were to be laid by the m'Ost savage men.", "holding fast the remote compensations which result from animal vigor. As the old fossil world shows that the first steps of reducing the chaos were confided to saurians and other huge and horrible animals, so the foundations of the new civility were to be laid by the m'Ost savage men. The Normans came out of France into EGgland worse men than they went into it one hundred and sixty years before. They had lost their own language and learned the Romance or bar- barous Latin of the Gauls, and had acquired with the language, all the vices it had names for. The conquest has obtained in the chronicles the name of the \"memory of sorrow.\" Twenty thou- sand thieves landed at Hastings. These founders of the House of Lords were greedy and ferocious dragons, sons of greedy and ferocious pirates. They were all alike, they took everything they could carry, they burned, harried, violated, tortured and killed\" until everything English was brought to the verge of ruin. Such however is the illusion of antiquity and wealth, that decent and dignified men now existing boast their descent from these filthy thieves, who showed a far juster conviction of their own merits, by assuming for their types the swine, goat, jackal, leopard, wolf and snake, which they severally resembled. England yielded to the Danes and Northmen in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and was the receptacle into which all the mettle of that strenuous population was poured. The continued draught of the best men in Norway, Sweden and Denmark to these piratical expeditions exhausted those countries, like a tree which bears much fruit when young, and these have been second- rate powers ever since. The power of the race migrated and left Norway void. King Olaf said, \"When King Harold, my father,", "best men in Norway, Sweden and Denmark to these piratical expeditions exhausted those countries, like a tree which bears much fruit when young, and these have been second- rate powers ever since. The power of the race migrated and left Norway void. King Olaf said, \"When King Harold, my father, ENGLISH TRAITS 555 went westvvard to England, the chosen men in Norway followed him; but Norway was so emptied then, that such men have not since been to find in the country, nor especially such a leader as King Harold was for wisdom and bravery.\" It was a tardy recoil of these invasions, when, in I 80I, the British government sent Nelson to bombard the Danish forts in the Sound, and, in 1807, Lord Cathcart, at Copenhagen, took the entire Danish fleet, as it lay in the basins, and all the equip .. ments from the Arsenal, and carried them to England. Konghelle, the town where the kings of Norway, Sweden and Denmark were wont to meet, is now rented to a private English gentleman for a hunting ground. It took many generations to trim and comb and perfume the first boat-load of Norse pirates into royal highnesses and most noble Knights of the Garter; but every sparkle of ornament datts back to the Norse boat. There will be time enough to mellow this strength into civility and religion. It is a medical fact that the children of the blind see; the children of felons have & healthy conscience.

The nation has a tough, acrid, animal nature, which centuries- of churching and civilizing have not been able to sweeten. Alfieri said \"the crimes of Italy were the proof of the superiority of the stock\"; and one may say of England that this watch moves on a splinter of adan1ant. The English uncultured are a brutal nation. The crimes recorded in their calendars leave nothing to be desired in the way of cold malignity. Dear to the English heart is a fair stand-up fight. The brutality of the manners in the lower class appears in the boxing, bear-baiting, cock-fighting, love of executions, and in the readiness for a set-to in the streets, delightful to the English of all classes. The costermongers of London streets hold cowardice in loathing: \"We must ,york our fists well; we are all handy with our fists\u00b7\" The pu hlic schools are charged with being bear-gardens of brutal strength, and are ... 556 ENGLISH TRAITS liked by the people for that cause. The fagging is a trait of the same quality. Medwin, in the Life of Shelley, relates that at a , military school they rolled up a young man in a snowball, and I left him so in his room while the other cadets went to church- and crippled him for life. They have retained impressment, deck- flogging, army-flogging, and school-flogging.

They have retained impressment, deck- flogging, army-flogging, and school-flogging. Such is the ferocity of the army discipline that a soldier, sentenced to flogging, some .. times prays that his sentence may be commuted to death. Flog .. ging, banished from the armies of ''Vestern Europe, remains here by the sanction of the Duke of Wellington. The right of the husband to sell the wife has been retained down to our times. The Jews have been the favorite victims of royal and popular persecution. Henry III mortgaged all the Jews in the kingdom to his brother the Earl of Cornwall, as security for money which he borrowed. The torture of criminals, and the rack for extorting evidence, were slowly disused. Of the criminal statutes, Sir Samuel Romilly said, \"I have examined the codes of all nations, and ours is the worst, and worthy of the Anthro .. pophagi.\" In the last session (1848), the House of Commons was listening to the details of flogging and torture practised in the jails. As soon as this land, thus geographically posted, got a hardy people into it, they could not help becoming the sailors and factors of the globe. From childhood, they dabbled in water, they swam like fishes, their playthings were boats. In the case of the ship-money, the judges delivered it for law, that \"England being an island, the very midland shires therein are all to be accounted maritime\"; and Fuller adds, \"the 'genius even of landlocked counties driving the natives with a maritime dex- terity.\" As early as the conquest, it is remarked, in explanation of the wealth of England, that its merchants trade to all countries.

The English at the present day have great vigor of body and endurance. Other countrymen look slight and undersized beside them, and invalids. They are bigger men than the Americans. I suppose a hundred English taken at random out of the street would weigh a fourth more than so many Americans. Yet, I am \u00a5Old, the skeleton is not larger. They are round, ruddy and hand .. ENGLISH TRAITS 557 some; at least the whole bust is well formed, and there is a tendency to stout and powerful frames. I remarked the stoutness on my first landing at Liverpool; porter, drayman, coachman, guard-what substantial, respectable, grandfatherly figures, with costume and manners to suit. The American has arrived at the old mansion-house and finds himself among uncles, aunts and grandsires. The pictures on the chimney-tiles of his nursery were pictures of these people. Here they are in the identical costumes and air which so took him. It is the fault of their forms that they grow stocky, and the women have that disadvantage-few tall, slender figures of flow ... ing shape, but stunted and thickset persons. The French say that the Englishwomen have two left hands. But in all ages they are a handsome race. The bronze monuments of crusaders lying cross-legged in the Temple Church at London, and those in Worcester and in Salisbury cathedrals, which are seven hun .. dred years old, are of the same type as the best youthful heads of men now in England-please by beauty of the same character, an", "bronze monuments of crusaders lying cross-legged in the Temple Church at London, and those in Worcester and in Salisbury cathedrals, which are seven hun .. dred years old, are of the same type as the best youthful heads of men now in England-please by beauty of the same character, an expression blending good-nature, valor and refinement, and mainly by that uncorrupt youth in the face of manhood, which is daily seen in the streets of London. Both branches of the Scandinavian race are distinguished for beauty. The anecdote of the handsome captives which Saini Gregory found at Rome, A.D. 600, is matched by the testimony of the Norman chroniclers, five centuries later, who wondered at the beauty and long flowing hair of the young English captives. Meantime the Heimskringla has frequent occasion to speak of the personal beauty of its heroes. When it is considered what humanity, what resources of mental and moral power the traits of the blonde race betoken, its accession to empire marks a new and finer epoch, wherein the old mineral force shall be subjugated . at last by humanity and shall plough in its furrow henceforward. It is not a final race, once a crab always crab-but a race with a future. On the English face are combined decision and nerve with the fair complexion, blue eyes and open and florid aspect. Hence the love of truth, hence the sensibility, the fine perception and 558 ENGLISH TRAITS poetic construction. The fair Saxon man, with open front and honest meaning, domestic, affectionate, is not the wood out of which cannibal, or inquisitor, or assassin is nlade, but he is moulded for law, lawful trade, civility, marriage, the nurture of children, for colleges, churches, charities and colonies. They are rather manly than warlike.

They are rather manly than warlike. When the war is over, the mask falls from the affectionate and domestic tastes, which make them women in kindness. This union of qualities is fabled in their national legend of '(Beauty and the \"Beast,\" or, long before, in the Greek legend of Hermaphrodite. rIle two sexes are co .. present in the English mind. I apply to Britannia, queen of seas and colonies, the words in which her latest novelist portrays his heroine; \"She is as mild as she IS game, and as game as she is mild.\" The English delight in the antagonism which combines in one person the extremes of courage and tenderness. Nelson, dying at Trafalgar, sends his love to Lord Collingwood, and like an innocent schoolboy tha:t goes to bed, says \"Kiss me, Hardy,\" and turns to sleep. Lord Collingwood, his comrade, was of a nature the most affectionate and domestic. Admiral Rodney's figure approached to delicacy and effeminacy, and he declared himself very sensible to fear, which he surmounted only by con- siderations of honor and public duty. Clarendon says the Duke of Buckingham was so modest and gentle, that some courtiers attempted to put affronts on him, until they found that this modesty and effeminacy was only a mask for the most terrible determination. And Sir Edward Parry said of Sir John Franklin, that \"if he found \\Vellington Sound open, he explored it; for he was a man who never turned his back on a danger, yet of that tenderness that he would not brush away a", "a mask for the most terrible determination. And Sir Edward Parry said of Sir John Franklin, that \"if he found \\Vellington Sound open, he explored it; for he was a man who never turned his back on a danger, yet of that tenderness that he would not brush away a mosquito.\" Even for their highwaymen the same virtue is claimed, and Robin Hood comes described to us as mitissimus prredonum j the gentlest thief. But they know where their war-dogs lie. Cromwell, Blake, ~farlborough, Chatham, Nelson and Wellington are not to be trifled with, and the brutal strength which lies at the bottom?f society, the animal ferocity of the quays and cockpits, the bullIes of the costermongers of Shoreditch, Seven Dials and Spitalfields, they kn_ow how to wake up. ENGLISH TRAITS 559 They have a vigorous health and last well into middle and old age. The old men are as red as roses, and still handsome. A clear skin, a peach-bloom complexion and good teeth are found all over the island. They use a plentiful and nutritious diet. The operative cannot subsist on water-cresses. Beef, mutton, wheat\" bread and malt-liquors are universal among the first-class labor .. ers. Good feeding is a chief point of national pride alnong the vulgar, and in their caricatures they represent the Frenchman as a poor, starved body_ It is curious that Tacitus found the English beer already in u'se among the Germans: \"They make from barley or wheat a drink corrupted into some reselnblance to wine.\" Lord Chief Justice Fortescue, in Henry VI's time, says, \"The inhabitants of England drink no water, unless at certain times on a religious score and by way of penance.\" The extremes of poverty and ascetic penance, it ,would seem, never reach cold water in England. Wood t.he antiquary,", "to wine.\" Lord Chief Justice Fortescue, in Henry VI's time, says, \"The inhabitants of England drink no water, unless at certain times on a religious score and by way of penance.\" The extremes of poverty and ascetic penance, it ,would seem, never reach cold water in England. Wood t.he antiquary, in describing the poverty and maceration of Father Lacey, an English Jesuit, does not deny him beer. He says, \"His bed was under a thatching, and the way to it up a ladder; his fare was coarse; his drink, of a penny a gawn, or gallon.\" They have more constitutional energy than any other people_ They think., with Henri Quatre, that nlanly exercises are the foundation of that elevation of mind which gives one nature ascendant over another; or with the Arabs, that the days spent in the chase are not counted in the length of life. They box, run, shoot, ride, row, and sail from pole to pole. They eat and drink., and live jolly in the open air, putting a bar of solid sleep between day and day. They walk and ride as fast as they can, their head bent forward, as if urged on some pressing affair. The French say that Englishmen in the street always walk straight before them like mad dogs. Men and women walk with infatuation. As soon as he can handle a gun, hunting is the fine art of every Englishman of condition. They are the most voracious people of prey thai ever existed. Every season turns out the aristocracy into the country to shoot and fish. The Inore vigorous run out of the island to America, to Asia, to Africa and Australia, to \\}unt with fury by gun, by trap, by harpoon, by lasso, with dog, ENGLISH TRAITS with horse, with elephant", "existed. Every season turns out the aristocracy into the country to shoot and fish. The Inore vigorous run out of the island to America, to Asia, to Africa and Australia, to \\}unt with fury by gun, by trap, by harpoon, by lasso, with dog, ENGLISH TRAITS with horse, with elephant or with dromedary, all the game that is in nature. These men have written the game-books of all countries, as Hawker, Scrope, Murray, Herbert, Maxwell, Cum .. ming and a host of travellers. The people at home are addicted to boxing, running, leaping and rowing matches. I suppose the dogs and horses must be thanked for the fact that the men have muscles almost as tough and supple as their own. If in every efficient man there is first a fine animal, in the English race it is of the best breed, a wealthy, juicy, broad- chested creature, steeped in ale and good cheer and a little over- loaded by his flesh. Men of animal nature rely, like animals, on their instincts. The Englishman associates well with dogs and horses. His attachment to the horse arises from the courage and address required to manage it. The horse finds out who is afraid of it, and does not disguise its opinion. Their young boiling clerks and lusty collegians like the company of horses better than the company of professors. I suppose the horses are better com- pany for them. The horse has more uses than BuffoD noted. If you go into the streets, every driver in 'bus or dray is a bully, and if I wanted a good troop of soldiers, I should recruit among the stables. Add a certain degree of refinement to the vivacity of these riders, and you obtain the precise quality which makes the men and women", "the streets, every driver in 'bus or dray is a bully, and if I wanted a good troop of soldiers, I should recruit among the stables. Add a certain degree of refinement to the vivacity of these riders, and you obtain the precise quality which makes the men and women of polite society formidable. They come honestly by their horsemanship, with Hengst and Horsa for their Saxon founders. The other branch of their race had been Tartar nomads. The horse was all their wealth. The children were fed on mares' milk. The pastures of Tartary were still remembered by the tenacious practice of the Norsemen to eat horseflesh at religious feasts. In the Danish invasions the marauders seized upon borses where they landed, and were at once converted into a body of expert cavalry. At one time this skill seems to have declined. Two centuries ago the English horse never performed any eminent service be- yond the seas; and the reason assigned was that the genius of the English hath always more inclined them to foot-service, as pure and proper manhood, without any mixture; whilst in a victory on horseback, the credit ought to be divided betwixt ENGLISH TRAITS 56I the man and his horse. But in two hundred years a change has taken place. Now, they boast that they understand horses better than any other people in the vvorld, and that their horses are become their second selves. \"William the Conqueror being,\" says Camden, ('better affected to beasts than to men, imposed heavy fIDes and punishments on those that should meddle with his game.\" The Saxon Chronicle says \"he loved the tall deer as if he were tpeir father.\" And rich Englishmen have followed his example, according to their ability, ever since, in encroaching on the tillage and commons", "to men, imposed heavy fIDes and punishments on those that should meddle with his game.\" The Saxon Chronicle says \"he loved the tall deer as if he were tpeir father.\" And rich Englishmen have followed his example, according to their ability, ever since, in encroaching on the tillage and commons with their game-preserves. It is a proverb in England that it is safer to shoot a man than a hare. The severity of the game-laws certainly indicates an extravagant sympathy of the nation with horses and hunters. The gentlemen are always on horseback, and have brought horses to an ideal perfection; the English racer is a factitious breed. A score or two of mounted gentlemen may fre\u00b7 quently be seen running like centaurs down a hill nearly as steep as the roof of a house. Every inn-room is lined with pictures oi races; telegraphs communicate, every hour, tidings of the heats from Newmarket and Ascot; and the House of Commons ad- journs over the \"Derby Day.\" CHAPTER V ABILITY THE Saxon and the Northman are both Scandinavians. History does not allow us to fix the limits of the application of thesu names with any accuracy, but from the residence of a portion of these people in France, and from some effect of that powerful soil on their blood and manners, the Norman has come popularly to represent in England the aristocratic, and the Saxon the democratic principle. And though, I doubt not, the nobles are of both tribes, and the workers of both, yet we are forced to use the names a little mythically, one to represent the workers and the other the en j oyer. The island was a prize for the best race. Each of the dominant ENGLISH TRAITS races tried its fortune in turn. The Phrenician, the", "workers of both, yet we are forced to use the names a little mythically, one to represent the workers and the other the en j oyer. The island was a prize for the best race. Each of the dominant ENGLISH TRAITS races tried its fortune in turn. The Phrenician, the Celt and the Goth had already got in. The Roman came, but in the very day when his fortune culminated. He looked in the eyes of a new people that was to supplant his own. He disembarked his legions, erected his camps and towers-presently he heard bad news from Italy, and worse and worse, every year; at last, he made a 'handsome compliment of roads and walls, and departed. But the Saxon seriously ~ett1ed in the land, builded, tilled, fished and traded, with German truth and adhesiveness. The Dane came and divided with him. Last of all the Norman or French- Dane arrived, and formally conquered, harried and ruled the kingdom. A century later it came out that the Saxon had the most bottom and longevity, had managed to make the victor speak the language and accept the law and usage of the victim; forced the baron to dictate Saxon terms to Norman kings; and, step by step, got all the essential securities of civil liberty in- vented and confirmed. The genius of the race and the genius of the place conspired to this effect. The island is lucrative to free labor, but not worth possession on other terms. The race was so intellectual that a feudal or military tenure could not last longer than the war. The power of the Saxon-Danes, so thoroughly beaten in the war that the name of English and villein were synonymous, yet so vivacious as to extort charters from the kings, stood on the", "race was so intellectual that a feudal or military tenure could not last longer than the war. The power of the Saxon-Danes, so thoroughly beaten in the war that the name of English and villein were synonymous, yet so vivacious as to extort charters from the kings, stood on the strong personality of these people. Sense and econ- IOmy must rule in a world which is made of sense and economy, and the banker, with his seven per cent., drives the earl out of his castle. A nobility of soldiers cannot keep down a commonalty of shrewd scientific persons. What signifies a pedigree of a hun- dred links, against a cotton-spinner with steam in his mill; or against a company of broad-shouldered Liverpool merchants, for whom Stephenson and BruneI are contriving locomotives and a tubular bridge? These Sa..\"\"{ons are the hands of mankind. They have the taste for toil, a distaste for pleasure or repose, and the telescopic appre- ciation of distant gain. They are the wealth-makers-and by dint of mental faculty which has its own conditions. The Saxon works after liking, or only for himself; and to set him at work ENGLISI-I TRAITS and to begin to draw his monstrous values out of barren Britain, all dishonor, fret and barrier must be removed, and then his energies begin to play. The Scandinavian fancied himself surrounded by Trolls-a kind of goblin Olen with vast power of work and skilful produc- tion-divine stevedores, carpenters, reapers, smiths and masons, swift to reward every kindness done them, with gifts of gold and silver. In all English history this dream comes to pass. Cer- tain Trolls or working brains, under the naines of Alfred, Bede, eaxton, Bracton, Camden, Drake, Selden, Dugdale, Newton, Gibbon, Brindley, Watt, Wedgwood, dwell in the troll-mounts of Britain and turn", "every kindness done them, with gifts of gold and silver. In all English history this dream comes to pass. Cer- tain Trolls or working brains, under the naines of Alfred, Bede, eaxton, Bracton, Camden, Drake, Selden, Dugdale, Newton, Gibbon, Brindley, Watt, Wedgwood, dwell in the troll-mounts of Britain and turn the sweat of their face to power and renown .. If the race is good, so is the place. Nobody landed on this spellhound island with impunity. The enchantnlents of barren shingle and rough weather transformed every adventurer into a laborer. Each vagabond that arrived bent his neck to the yoke of gain, or found the air too tense for hitn. The strong survived, the \\veaker went to the ground. Even the pleasure-hunters and sots of England are of a tougher texture. A hard temperament had been formed by Saxon and Saxon-Dane, and such of these French or Normans as could reach it were naturalized in every sense. All the admirable expedients or means hit upon in England must be looked at as growths or irresistible offshoots of the expanding mind of the race. A man of that brain thinks and acts thus; and his neighbor, being afflicted with the same kind of brain, though he is rich and called a baron or a duke, thinks the same thing, and is ready to allow the justice of the thought and act in his retainer or tenant, though sorely against his baronial or ducal will. The island was renowned in antiquity for its breed of mastiffs, so fierce that when their teeth were sct you must cut their heads off to part them. The man was like his dog.

The man was like his dog. The people have that nervous bilious tenlperament which is known by medical men to resist every means employed to make its pos .. sessor subservient to the will of others. The English ganle is main force to main force, the planting of foot to foot, fair play ENGLISH TRAITS and open field-a rough tug without trick or dodging, till one or both come to pieces. King Ethelwald spoke the language of his race when he planted himself at Wimborne and said he \"would do one of two things, or there live, or there lie.\" They hate craft and subtlety_ They neither poison, nor waylay, nor assas- sinate; and when they have pounded each other to a poultice, they will shake hands and be friends for the remainder of their lives. You shall trace these Gothic touches at school, at country fairs, at the hustings and in parliament. No artifice, no breach of truth and plain dealing-not so much as secret ballot, is suffered in the island. In parliament, the tactics of the opposi- tion is to resist every step of the government by a pitiless attack: and in a bargain, no prospect of advantage is so dear to the merchant as the thought of being tricked is mortifying. Sir Kenelm Digby, a courtier of Charles and James, who won the sea-fight of Scanderoon, was a nlodel Englishman in his day. \"His person was handsome and gigantic, he had so graceful elo- cution and noble address, that, had he been dropt out of the clouds in any part of the ,vorld, he would have made himself respected: he was skilled in six tongues,", "Scanderoon, was a nlodel Englishman in his day. \"His person was handsome and gigantic, he had so graceful elo- cution and noble address, that, had he been dropt out of the clouds in any part of the ,vorld, he would have made himself respected: he was skilled in six tongues, and master of arts and arms.\" Sir Kenelm wrote a book, Of Bodies and of Souls, in which he propounds, that \"syllogisms do breed, or rather are all the variety of man's life. They are the steps by which we walk in all our businesses. l\\fan, as he is man, doth nothing else but weave such chains. Whatsoever, he doth, swarving from this work, he doth as deficient from the nature of man: and, if he do ,,\"ught beyond this, by breaking out into divers sorts of ex- terior actions, he findeth, nevertheless, in this linked sequel of simplest discourses, the art, the cause, the rule, the bounds and the model of it.\" There spoke the genius of the English people. There is a necessity on them to be logical. They would hardly greet the good that did not logically fall-as if it excluded their own merit, or shook their understandings. They are jealous of minds that have much facility of association, from an instinctive fear that the seeing many relations to their thought might impair this ENGLISH TRAITS serial continuity and lucrative concentration. They are impa ... tient of genius, or of minds addicted to contemplation, and can ... not conceal their contempt for sallies of thought, however law- ful, whose steps they cannot count by their wonted rule. Neither do they reckon better a syllogism that ends in syllogism. FOl they have a supreme eye to facts, and theirs is a logic that brings salt to soup, hammer", "not conceal their contempt for sallies of thought, however law- ful, whose steps they cannot count by their wonted rule. Neither do they reckon better a syllogism that ends in syllogism. FOl they have a supreme eye to facts, and theirs is a logic that brings salt to soup, hammer to nail, oar to boat; the logic of cooks, carpenters and chemists, following the sequence of nature, and one on which words make no impression. Their mind is not dazzled by its own means, but locked and bolted to results. They love men who, like Samuel Johnson, a doctor in the schools, would jump out of his syllogism the instant his major proposi ... ... tion was in danger, to save that at all hazards. Their practical vision is spacious, and they can hold many threads without entangling them. All the steps they orderly take; but with the high logic of never confounding the minor and major proposi- tion; keeping their eye on their aim 1 in all the complicity and delay incident to the several series of nleans thp.y employ. There is room in their minds for this and that-a science of degrees. In the courts the independence of the judges and the loyalty of the suitors are equally excellent. In parliament they have hit on that capital invention of freedom, a constitutional opposition. And when courts and parlialnent are both deaf, the plaintiff is not silenced. Calm, patient, his weapon of defence frOln year to year is the obstinate reproduction of the grievance, with calcula- tions and estimates. But, meantime, he is drawing nUlnbers and money to his opinion, resolved that if all remedy fails, right of revolution is at the bott01TI of his charter-box.

But, meantime, he is drawing nUlnbers and money to his opinion, resolved that if all remedy fails, right of revolution is at the bott01TI of his charter-box. They are bound to see their measure carried, and stick to it through ages of defeat. Into this English logic, however, an infusion of justice enters, not so apparent in other races-a belief in the existence of two. sides, and the resolution to see fair play. There is on every ques .. tion an appeal from the assertion of the parties to the proof of what is asserted. They kiss the dust before a fact. Is it a rna .. chine, is it a charter, is it a boxer in the ring, is it a candidate on the hustings-the universe of Englishmen will suspend their judgment until the trial can be had. They are not to be led by ENGLISH TRAITS a phrase, they want a working plan, a working machine, a work- ing constitution. and will sit out the trial and abide by the issue a;d reject all preconceived theories. In politics they put blunt questions, which must be answered; \\Vho is to pay the taxes? '\\Vhat will you do for trade? What for corn? What for the spinner? This singular fairness and its results strike the French with surprise. Philip de Commines says, \"Now, in my opinion, among all the sovereignties I know in the world, that in which the public good is best attended to, and the least violence exercised on the people, is that of England.\" Life is safe, and personal rights; and what is freedom without security? whilst, in France, \"fraternity,\" \"equality,\" and !!indivisible unity\" are names for assassination. Montesquieu said, \"England is the freest country in the", "good is best attended to, and the least violence exercised on the people, is that of England.\" Life is safe, and personal rights; and what is freedom without security? whilst, in France, \"fraternity,\" \"equality,\" and !!indivisible unity\" are names for assassination. Montesquieu said, \"England is the freest country in the world. If a man in England had as many enemies as hair on his head, no harm would happen to him.\" Their self-respect, their faith in causation, and their realistic logic or coupling of means to ends, have given them the leadership of the modern world. 1\\1ontesquieu said, \"No people have true common-sense but those who are born in England.\" This com- mon-sense is a perception of all the conditions of our earthly existence; of laws that can be stated, and of laws that cannot be stated, or that are learned only by practice, in which allowance for friction is made. They are impious in their skepticism of theory, and in high departments they are cramped and sterile. But the unconditional surrender to facts, and the choice of means to reach their ends, are as admirable as with ants and bees. The bias of the nation is a passion for utility. They love the lever, the screw and pulley, the Flanders draught-horse, the waterfall, wind-mills, tide-mills; the sea and the wind to bear their freight ships. lVIore than the diamond Koh-i-noor, which glitters among their crown jewels, they prize that dull pebble which is wiser than a man, whose poles turn themselves to the poles of the world, and whose axis is parallel to the axis of the world. Now, their toys are steam and galvanism. They are heavy at the fine arts, but adroit at the coarse ~ not good in jewelry or ENGLISH TRAITS mosaics, but the best", "turn themselves to the poles of the world, and whose axis is parallel to the axis of the world. Now, their toys are steam and galvanism. They are heavy at the fine arts, but adroit at the coarse ~ not good in jewelry or ENGLISH TRAITS mosaics, but the best iron-masters, colliers, wool-combers and tanners in Europe. They apply themselves to agriculture, to draining, to resisting encroachments of sea, wind, travelling sands, cold and wet sub-soil; to fishery, to manufacture of indis .. pensable staples-salt, plumbago, \"leather, wool, glass, pottery and brick-to bees and silkworms-and by their steady combina- tions they succeed. A manufacturer sits down to dinner in a suit of clothes which was wool on a sheep's back at sunrise. You dine with a gentleman on venison, pheasant, quail, pigeons, paul .. try, mushrooms and pine-apples, all the growth of his estate. They are neat husbands for ordering all their tools pertaining to house and field. All are well kept. There is no want and no waste. They study use and fitness in their building, in the order of their dwellings and in their dress. The Frenchman invented the ruffle; the Englishman added the shirt. The Englishman wears a sensible coat buttoned to the chin, of rough but solid and lasting texture. If he is a lord, he dresses a little worse than a commoner. They have diffused the taste for plain substantial hats, shoes and coats through Europe. They think him the best dressed man whose dress is so fit for his use that you cannot notice or remember to describe it. They secure the essentials in their diet, in their arts and manu .. factures.

The admirable equipment of their arctic ships carries London to the pole. They build roads, aqueducts; warm and ventilate houses .. And they have. impressed their directness and practical habit on modern civili .. zation. In trade, the Englishman believes that nobody breaks who ought not to break; and that if he do not make trade everything, it will make him nothing; and acts on this belief. The spirit of system, attention to details, and the subordination of details, or the not driving things too finely (which is charged on the Ger- mans), constitute that dispatch of business \"vhich makes the mercantile power of England. 568 ENGLISH TRAITS In war, the Englishman looks to his means. He is of the opinion of Civilis, his German ancestor, whom Tacitus reports as holding that \"the gods are on the side of the strongest\"-a sentence which Bonaparte unconsciously translated, when he said that \"he had noticed that Providence always favored the heaviest battalion.\" Their military science propounds that if the weight of the advancing column is greater than that of the resisting, the latter is destroyed. Therefore, Wellington, when he came to the army in Spain, had every man weighed, first with accoutrements, and then without; believing that the force of an army depended on the weight and power of the individual soldiers, in spite of cannon. Lord Palmerston told the House", "the latter is destroyed. Therefore, Wellington, when he came to the army in Spain, had every man weighed, first with accoutrements, and then without; believing that the force of an army depended on the weight and power of the individual soldiers, in spite of cannon. Lord Palmerston told the House of Commons that IDore care is taken of the health and comfort of English troops than o\u00b7f any other troops in the wor ld; and that hence the English can put more men into the rank, on the day of action, on the field of battle, than any other army. Before the bombardment of the Danish forts in the Baltic, Nelson spent day after day, himself, in the boats, on the exhausting service of sounding the channel. Clerk of Eldin's celebrated manreuvre of breaking the line of sea-battle, and Nelson's feat of doubling, Dr stationing his ships one on the outer bow, and another on the outer quarter of each of the enemy's, were only translations into naval tactics of Bonaparte's rule of concentration. Lord Collingwood was accustomed to tell his men that if they could fire three well-directed broadsides in five minutes, no vessel could resist them; and from constant practice they came to do it in three minutes and a half. But conscious that no race of better men exists, they rely most on the simplest means, and do not like ponderous and difficult tactics, but delight to bring the affair hand to hand; where the victory lies with the strength, courage and endurance of the individual combatants. They adopt every improvement in rig, in motor, in weapons, but they fundamentally believe that the best stratagem in naval war is to lay your ship close along .. side of the enemy's ship and bring all your guns to", "with the strength, courage and endurance of the individual combatants. They adopt every improvement in rig, in motor, in weapons, but they fundamentally believe that the best stratagem in naval war is to lay your ship close along .. side of the enemy's ship and bring all your guns to beal on him, until you or he go to the bottom. This is the old fashion, which never goes out of fashionJ neither in nor out of England. ENGLISH TRAITS It is not usually a point of honor, nor a religious sentiment, and never any whim, that they will shed their blood for; but usually property, and right measured by property, that breeds revolution. They have no Indian taste for a tomahawk-dance, no French taste for a badge or a proclamation. The Englishman is peaceably minding his business and earning his day's wages. But if you offer to lay hand on his day's wages, on his cow, or his right in common, or his shop, he will fight to the Judgment. Magna-charta, jury-trial, habeas-corpus, star-chamber, ship- money, Popery, Plymouth colony, American Revolution, are all questions involving a yeoman's right to his dinner, and except as touching that, would not have lashed the British nation to rage and revolt. Whilst they are thus instinct with a spirit of order and 01 calculation, it must be owned they are capable of larger views; but the indulgence is expensive to them, costs great crises, or accumulations of mental power. In common, the horse works best with blinders. Nothing ic;; more in the line of English thought than uur unvarnished Connecticut question, \"Pray, sir, how do you get your living when you are at home?\" The questions of freedom, of taxation, of privilege, are money questions.

Nothing ic;; more in the line of English thought than uur unvarnished Connecticut question, \"Pray, sir, how do you get your living when you are at home?\" The questions of freedom, of taxation, of privilege, are money questions. Heavy fellows, steeped in beer and fleshpots, they are hard of hearing and dim of sight. Their drowsy minds need to be flagellated by war and trade and politics and persecution. They cannot well read a principle, except by the light of fagots and of burning towns. Tacitus says of the Germans, (CPowerful only in sudden efforts, they are impatient of toil and labor.\" This highly destined race, if it bad not somewhere added the chamber of patience to its brain, would not have built London. I know not from which of the tribes and temperaments that went to the composition of the people ihis tenacity was supplied, but they clinch every nail they drive. They have no running for luck, and no immoderate speed. They spend largely on their fabric, and await the slow return. Their leather lies tanning seven years in the vat. At Rogers's mills, in Sheffield, where I was shown the process of making a razor and a penknife, I was told there is no luck in 570 ENGLISH TRAITS making good steel; that they make no mistakes, every blade in the hundred and in the thousand is good. And that is charac- teristic of all their work~no more is attempted than is done. When Thor and his companions arrive at Utgard, he is told that \"nobody is permitted to remain here, unless he understand some art, and excel in it all other men.\" The same question is still put to the posterity of Thor.

A nation of laborers, every man is trained to some one art or detail and aims at perfection in that; not content unless he has something in which he thinks he sur- passes all other men. He would rather not do anything at all than not do it well. I suppose no people have such thoroughness- from the highest to the lowest, every man meaning to be master of his art. \"To show capacity,\" a Frenchman described as the end of a speech in debate: \"No,\" said an Englishman, \"but to set your shoulder at the wheel-to advance the business.\" Sir Samuel Romilly refused to speak in popular assemblies, confining himself to the House of Commons, where a measure can be carried by a speech .. The business of the House of Commons is conducted by a few persons, but these are hard-worked. Sir Robert Peel \"knew the Blue Books by heart.\" His colleagues and rivals carry Han ... sard in their heads. The high civil and legal offices are not beds of ease, but posts which exact frightful amounts of mental labor . Many of the great leaders, like Pitt, Canning, Castlereagh, Ro .. milly, are soon worked to death. They are excellent judges in England of a good worker, and when they find one, like Claren- don, Sir Philip Warwick, Sir William Coventry, Ashley, Burke, Thurlow, Mansfield, Pitt, Eldon, Peel, or Russell, there is noth- ing too good or too high for him. They have a wonderful heat in the pursuit of a public aim. Private persons", "good worker, and when they find one, like Claren- don, Sir Philip Warwick, Sir William Coventry, Ashley, Burke, Thurlow, Mansfield, Pitt, Eldon, Peel, or Russell, there is noth- ing too good or too high for him. They have a wonderful heat in the pursuit of a public aim. Private persons exhibit, in scientific and antiquarian researches, the same pertinacity as the nation showed in the coalitions in which it yoked Europe against the empire of Bonaparte, one after the other defeated, and still renewed, until the sixth hurled him from his seat. Sir John Herschel, in completion of the work of his father, who had made the catalogue of the stars of the northern hemi .. ENGLISH TRAITS 57 1 sphere, expatriated himself for years at the Cape of Good Hope, finished his inventory of the southern heaven, came home, and redacted it in eight years more-a work whose value does not begin until thirty years have elapsed, and thenceforward a rec- ord to all ages of the highest import. The Admiralty sent out the Arctic expeditions year after year, in search of Sir John Franklin, until at last they have threaded their way through polar pack and Behring's Straits and solved the geographical problem. Lord Elgin, at Athens, saw the imminent ruin of the Greek remains, set up his scaffoldings, in spite of epigrams, and, after five years' labor to collect them, got his marbles on ship-board. The ship struck a rock and went to the bottom. He had them all fished up by divers, at a vast expense, and brought to London; not know- ing that Haydon, Fuseli and Canova, and all good heads in all the world, were to be his applauders.

In the same spirit, were the excavation and research by Sir Charles Fellowes for the Xanthian monument, and of Layard for his Nineveh sculp- tures. The nation sits in the immense city they have builded, a London extended into every man's mind, though he live in Van Dieman's Land or Capetown. Faithful performance of what is undertaken to be performed, they honor in themselves, and exact in others, as certificate of equality with themselves .. The modern world is theirs. They have made and make it day by day. The commercial relations of the world are so intimately drawn to London, that every dollar on earth contributes to the strength of the English government. And if all the wealth in the planet should perish by war or deluge, they know themselves competent to replace it. They have approved their Saxon blood, by their sea .. going qualities; their descent from Odin's smiths, by their hereditary skill in working in iron; their British birth, by husbandry and immense wheat harvests; and justified their occupancy of the. centre of habitable land, by their supreme ability and cosmo .. politan spirit. They have tilled, builded, forged, spun and woven. They have made the island a thoroughfare, and London a shop, a law .. court, a record-office and scientific bureau, inviting to 57 2 ENGLISH TRAITS strangers; a sanctuary to refugees of every political and religious opinion; and such a city that almost every active man, in any nation, finds himself at one time or other forced to visit it. In every path of practical activity they have gone", "bureau, inviting to 57 2 ENGLISH TRAITS strangers; a sanctuary to refugees of every political and religious opinion; and such a city that almost every active man, in any nation, finds himself at one time or other forced to visit it. In every path of practical activity they have gone even with the best. There is no secret of war in which they have not shown mastery. The steam-chamber of Watt, the locomotive of Stephen- son, the cotton-mule of Roberts, perform the labor of the world. There is no department of literature, of science, or of useful art, in which they have not produced a first-rate book. It is England whose opinion is waited for on the merit of a new invention, an improved science. And in the complications of the trade and politics of their vast empire, they have been equal to every exigency, with counsel and with conduct. Is it their luck, or is it the chambers of their brain-it is their commercial advantage that whatever light appears in better method or happy invention, breaks out in their race. They are a family to which a destiny attaches, and the Banshee has sworn that a male heir shall never be wanting. They have a wealth of men to fill important posts, and the vigilance of party criticism insures the selection of a competent person. A proof of the energy of the British people is the highly arti .. ficial construction of the whole fabric. The climate and geogra- phy, I said, were factitious, as if the hands of man had arranged the conditions. The same character pervades the whole kingdom. Bacon said, \"Rome was a state not subject to paradoxes\"; but England subsists by antagonisms and contradictions.

Bacon said, \"Rome was a state not subject to paradoxes\"; but England subsists by antagonisms and contradictions. The foun- dations of its greatness are the rolling waves; and from first to last it is a museum of anomalies. This foggy and rainy country furnishes the world with astronomical observations. Its short rivers do not afford water-power, but the land shakes under the thunder of the mills. There is no gold-mine of any importance, but there is more gold in England than in all other countries. It is too far north for the culture of the vine, but the wines of all countries are in its docks. The French Cornte de Lauraguais said, \"No fruit ripens in England but a baked apple\"; but oranges and pine-apples are as cheap in London as in the Medi- ENGLISH TRAITS 573 terranean. The Mark-Lane Express, or the Custom House Re .. turns, bear out to the letter the vaunt of Pope- \"Let India boast her palms, nor envy we The weeping amber, nor the spicy tree, While, by our oaks, those precious loads are borne, And realms commanded which those trees adorn.\" The native cattle are extinct, but the island is full of artificial breeds. The agriculturist Bakewell created sheep and cows and horses to order, and breeds in which every thing was omitted but what is economical. The cow is sacrificed to her bag, the ox to his sirloin. Stall-feeding makes sperm-mills of the cattle, and converts the stable to a chemical factory. The rivers, lakes and ponds, too much fished, or obstructed by factories, are artificially filled with the eggs of salmon, turbot and herring. Chat Moss and the fens", "to her bag, the ox to his sirloin. Stall-feeding makes sperm-mills of the cattle, and converts the stable to a chemical factory. The rivers, lakes and ponds, too much fished, or obstructed by factories, are artificially filled with the eggs of salmon, turbot and herring. Chat Moss and the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire are unhealthy and too barren to pay rent. By cylindrical tiles and gutta-percha tubes, five millions of acres of bad land have been drained and put on equality with the best, for rape-culture and grass. The climate too, which was already believed to have become milder and drier by the enormous consumption of coal, is so far reached by this new action, that fogs and storms are said to disappear. In due course, all England will be drained and rise a second thne out of the waters. The latest step was to call in the aid of steam to agriculture. Steam is almost an Englishman. I do not know but they will send him to Parliament next, to make laws. He weaves, forges, saws, pounds, fans, and now he must pump, grind, dig and plough for the farmer. The markets created by the manufacturing population have erected agriculture into a great thriving and spending industry. The value of the houses in Britain is equal to the value of the soil. Artificial aids of all kinds are cheaper than the natural resources. No man can afford to walk, when the parliamentary-train carries him for a penny a mile. Gas-burners are cheaper than daylight in numberless floors in the cities. All the houses in London buy their water. The English trade does not exist for the exportation of native produc.ts, but on its manufactures, or the malting well j 574 ENGLISH TRAITS every thing which is ill-made elsewhere.", "mile.

The English trade does not exist for the exportation of native produc.ts, but on its manufactures, or the malting well j 574 ENGLISH TRAITS every thing which is ill-made elsewhere. They make ponchos for the Mexican, bandannas for the Hindoo, ginseng for the Chinese, beads for the Indian, laces for the Flemings, telescopes for astronomers, cannons for kings. The Board of Trade caused the best models of Greece and Italy to be placed within the reach of every manufacturing popu ... lation. They caused to be translated from foreign languages and illustrated by elaborate drawings, the most approved works of Munich, Berlin and Paris. They have ransacked Italy to find new forms, to add a grace to the products of their looms, their potteries and their foundries. The nearer we look, the more artificial is their social system. Their law is a network of fictions. Their property, a scrip or certificate of right to interest on money that no man ever saw. Their social classes are made by statute. Their ratios of power and representation are historical and legal. The last Reform-bill took away political power from a mound, a ruin and a stone wall, whilst Birmingham and Manchester, whose mills paid for the wars of Europe, had no representative. Purity in the elective Parliament is secured by the purchase of seats. Foreign power is kept by armed colonies; power at honle, by a standing army of police. The pauper lives better than the free laborer, the thief better than the pauper, and the transported felon better than the one under imprisonment. The crimes are factitious; as smuggling, poaching, nonconformity, heresy and treason. The sovereignty of the seas is maintained", "at honle, by a standing army of police. The pauper lives better than the free laborer, the thief better than the pauper, and the transported felon better than the one under imprisonment. The crimes are factitious; as smuggling, poaching, nonconformity, heresy and treason. The sovereignty of the seas is maintained by the impressment of seamen .. \"The impressment of seamen,\" said Lord Eldon, \"is the life of our navy.\" Solvency is maintained by means of a national debt, on the principle, \"If you will not lend me the money, how can I pay you?\" For the administration of justice, Sir Samuel Romilly's expedient for clearing the arrears of business in Chan- cery was, the Chancellor's staying away entirely from his court. Their system of education is factitious. The Universities gal- vanize dead languages into a semblance of life. Their church is artificial. The manners and customs of society are ar:tificial- made-up men with made-up manners----and thus the whole is Birminghamized, and we have a nation whose existence is a work ENGLISH TRAITS 575 of art-a cold, barren, almost arctic isle being made the most fruitful, luxurious and imp erial land in the whole earth. Man in England submits to be a product of political economy .. On a bleak moor a mill is built, a banking-house is opened, and men come in as water in a sluice-way, and towns and cities rise. Man is made as a Birmingham button. The rapid doubling of the population dates from Watt's steam-engine. A landlord who owns a province says, \"The tenantry are unprofitable; let me have sheep.\" He unroofs the houses and ships the population to America. The nation is accustomed to the instantaneous creation of wealth. It is the maxim of their economists, \"that the greater part in value of the wealth", "landlord who owns a province says, \"The tenantry are unprofitable; let me have sheep.\" He unroofs the houses and ships the population to America. The nation is accustomed to the instantaneous creation of wealth. It is the maxim of their economists, \"that the greater part in value of the wealth now existing in England has been produced by human hands within the last twelve months.\" Mean .. time, three or four days' rain will reduce hundreds to starving In London. One secret of their power is their mutual good understanding. Not only good minds are born among them, but all the people have good minds. Every nation has yielded some good wit, if, as has chanced to many tribes, only one. But the intellectual organization of the English admits a communicableness of knowl .. edge and ideas among them all. An electric touch by any of theii national ideas, melts them into one family and brings the hoards of power which their individuality is always hiving, into use and play for all. Is it the smallness of the country, or is it the pride and affection of race-they have solidarity, or responsibleness, and trust in each other. Their minds, like wool, admit of a dye which is more lasting than the cloth. They embrace their cause with more tenacity than their life .. Though not military, yet every common subject by the poll is fit to make a soldier of. These private, reserved, mute family-men can adopt a public end with all their heat, and this strength of affection makes the romance of their heroes. The dif- ference of rank does not divide the national heart. The Danish poet OehlenschHiger complains that who writes in Danish writes to two hundred readers.

The Danish poet OehlenschHiger complains that who writes in Danish writes to two hundred readers. In Germany there is one speech for the learned, and another for the masses, to that extent that, it is said, no sentiment or phrase from the works of any great German \u2022 ENGLISH TRAITS writer is ever heard among the lower classes. But in England, the language of the noble is the language of the poor. In Parliament, in pulpits, in theatres, when the speakers rise to thought and. passion, the language becomes idiomatic; the people in the street best understand the best words. And their language seems drawn from the Bible, the Common Law and the works of Shakspeare, Bacon, Milton, Pope, Young, Cowper, Burns and Scott. The island has produced two or three of the greatest men that ever existed, but they were not solitary in their town time. Men quickly embodied what Newton found out, in Greenwich observa- tories and practical navigation. The boys know all that Hutton knew of strata, or Dalton of atoms, or Harvey of blood-vessels; and these studies, once dangerous, are in fashion. So what is invented or known in agriculture, or in trade, or in war, or in art, or in literature and antiquities. A great ability, not amassed nn a few giants, but poured into the general mind, so that each of them could at a pinch stand in the shoes of the other; and they are more bound in character than differenced in ability or in rank..

The laborer is a possible lord. The lord is a possible basket-maker. Every man carries the English system in his brain, knows what is confided to him and does therein the best he can. The chancellor carries England on his mace, the midshipman at the point of his dirk, the smith on his hammer, the cook in the bowl of his spoon; the postilion cracks his whip for England, and the sailor times his oars to \"God save the King!\" The very felons have their pride in each other's English stanchness. In politics and in war they hold together as by hooks of steel. The charm in Nelson's history is the unselfish greatness, the assurance of being supported to the uttermost by those whom he supports to the uttermost. Whilst they are some ages ahead of the rest of the world in the art of living; whilst in some directions they do not represent the modem spirit but constitute it-this vanguard of civility and power they coldly hold, marching in phalanx, lockstep, foot after foot, file after :file of heroes, ten thousand deep_ ENGLISH TRAITS 577 CHAPTER VI MANNERS I FIND the Englishman to be him of all men who stands firmest in his shoes.

The word is not beautiful, but on the quality they signify by it the nation is unanimous. The cabmen have it; the merchants have it; the bishops have it; the women have it; the journals have it; the Times newspaper they say is the pluckiest thing in England, and Sydney Smith had made it a proverb that little Lord John Rus- sell, the minister, would take the command of the Channel fleet to-morrow.

Nothing but the most serious business could give one any counterweight to these Bare- sarks, though they were only to order eggs and muffins for their breakfast. The Englishman speaks with all his body. His elocu- tion is stomachic-as the American's is labial. The Englishman is very petulant and precise about his accommodation at inns and on the roads; a quiddle about his toast and his chop and every species of convenience, and loud and pungent in his expres- sions of impatience at any neglect. His vivacity betrays itself at all points, in his manners, in his respiration, and the inarticulate noises he makes in clearing the throat-all significant of burly strength.

He has stamina; he can take the initiative in emergen- cies. He has that aplomb which results from a good adjustment of the moral and physical nature and the obedience of all the powers to the will; as if the axes of his eyes were united to his backbone, and only moved with the trunk. This vigor appears in the incuriosity and stony neglect, each of every other. Each man walks, eats, drinks, shaves, dresses, gestic- ulates, and, in every manner acts and suffers without reference to the bystanders, in his own fashion, only careful not to interfere with them or annoy them; not that he is trained to neglect the eyes of his neighbors-he is really occupied with his own affair and does not think. of them. Every man in this polished country consults only his convenience, as much as a solitary pioneer in Wisconsin. I know not where any personal eccentricity is so freely allowed, and no man gives himself any concern with it. An Englishman walks in a pouring rain, swinging his closed umbrella like a walking-stick; wears a wig, or a shawl, or a saddle, or stands on his head, and no remark is made. And as he has been doing this for several generations, it is now in the blood. In short, every one of these islanders is an island himself, safe, ENGLISH TRAl~S 579 tranquil, incommunicable ..

He does not let you meet his eyea It is almost an affront to look a man in the face without being introduced. In mixed or in select companies they do not introduce persons; so that a presentation is a circumstance as valid as a contract. Introduc- tions are sacraments. He withholds his name. At the hotel, he is hardly willing to whisper it to the clerk at the book--office. If he give you his private address on a card, it is like an avowal of friendship; and his bearing, on being introduced, is cold, even. though he is seeking your acquaintance and is studying how he shall serve you. It was an odd proof of this impressive energy, that in my lectures I hesitated to read and threw out for its impertinence many a disparaging phrase which I had been accustomed to spin. about poor, thin, unable mortals; so much had the fine physique and the personal vigor of this robust race worked on my imagina- tion.

The power and possession which surround them are their own creation, and they exert the same commanding industry at this moment. They are positive, methodical, cleanly and formal, loving rou- t1ne and conventional ways; loving truth and religion, to be sure, but inexorable on points of form. All the world praises the com- fort and private appointments of an English inn, and of English households. You are sure of neatness and of personal decorum. A Frenchman may possibly be clean; an Englishman is conscien- tiously clean. A certain order and complete propriety is found ir>. his dress and in his belongings. 580 ENGLISH TRAITS Born in a harsh and wet climate, which keeps him indoors whenever he is at rest, and being of an affectionate and loyal temper, he dearly loves his house. If he is rich, he buys a demesne and builds a hall; if he is in middle condition, he spares no expense on his house.

Incredible amounts of plate are found in good houses, and the poorest have some spoon or saucepan, gift of a godmother, saved out of better times. An English family consists of a few persons, who, from youth to age, are found revolving within a fe~' feet of each other, as if tied by some invisible ligature, tense as that cartilage which we have seen attaching the two Siamese. England produces under favorable conditions of ease and culture the finest women in the world. And as the men are affectionate and true-hearted, the women inspire and refine them. N othin~ can be more delicate without being fantastical, nothing more firm and based in nature and sentiment, than the courtship and mutual carriage of the sexes. The song of 1596 says, \"The wife ot every Englishman is counted blest.\" The sentiment of Imogen iD Cymbeline is copied from English nature; and not less the Portia of Brutus, the Kate Percy and the Desdemona .. The romance does not exceed the heigh~ of noble passion in 1\\1rs.

Noth- ENGLISH TRAITS ing SO much marks their manners as the concentration on their household ties. This domesticity is carried into court and camp. Wellington governed India and Spain and his own troops, and fought battles, like a good family-man, paid his debts, and though general of an army in Spain, could not stir abroad for fear of public creditors. This taste for house and parish merits has of course its doting and foolish side. Mr. Cobbett attributes the huge popularity of Perceval, prime minister in 1810, to the fact that he was wont to go to church every Sunday, with a large quarto gilt prayer-hook under one arm, his wife hanging on the other, and followed by a long brood of children. They keep their' old customs, costumes, and pomps, their wig and mace, sceptre and crown. The Middle Ages still lurk in the streets of London. The Knights of the Bath take oath to defend injured ladies; the gold-stick-in-waiting survives. They repeated the ceremonies of the eleventh century in the coronation of the present Queen. A hereditary tenure is natural to them. Offices, farms, trades and traditions descend so. Their leases run for a hundred and a thousand years. Terms of service and partner- ship are lifelong, or are inherited. \"Holdship has been with me,\" said Lord Eldon, \"eight-and-twenty years, knows all my business and books.\" Antiquity of usage is sanction enough.

Wordsworth says of the small freeholders of Westmoreland, \"Many of these humble sons of the hills had a consciousness that the land which they tilled had for more than five hundred years been possessed by men of the same name and blood.\" The ship-carpenter in the public yards, my lord's gardener and porter, have been there for more than a hundred years, grandfather, father, and son. The English power resides also in their dislike of change. The)' have difficulty in bringing their reason to act, and on all occasions use their men10ry first. As soon as they have rid themselves of some grievance and settled the better practice, they make haste to fix it as a finality, and never wish to hear of alteration more. Every Englishman is an embryonic chancellor: his instinct is to search for a precedent. The favorite phrase of their law is, \"a custom whereof the memory of man runneth not back to the contrary.\" The barons say, \"N olumus mutari\"; and the cockneys ENGLISH TRAITS !tifie the curiosity of the foreigner on the reason of any practice with \"Lord, sir, it was always so.\" They hate innovation. Bacon told them, Time was the right reformer; Chatham, that \"confi,\u00b7 dence was a plant of slow growth\"; Canning, to \"advance with the times\"; and Wellington, that \"habit was ten times nature.\" All their statesmen learn the irresistibility of the tide of custom, and have invented many fine phrases to cover this slowness of perception and prehensility of tail. A sea-shell should be the crest of England, not only because it represents a power built on the waves, but", "ten times nature.\" All their statesmen learn the irresistibility of the tide of custom, and have invented many fine phrases to cover this slowness of perception and prehensility of tail. A sea-shell should be the crest of England, not only because it represents a power built on the waves, but also the hard finish of the men. The Englishman is finished like a cowry or a murex. After the spire and the spines are formed, or with the formation, a juice exudes and a hard enamel vacnishes every part. The keeping of the proprieties is as indispensable as clean linen. No merit quite countervails the want of this whilst this sometimes stands in lieu of alL \" 'T is in bad taste,\" is the most formidable word an Englishman can pronounce. But this japan costs them dear. There is a prose in certain Englishmen which exceeds in wooden deadness all rivalry with other countrymen. There is a knell in the conceit and externality of their voice, which seems to say, Leave all hope behind. In this Gibraltar of propriety, mediocrity gets intrenched and consolidated and founded in adamant. An Englishman of fashion is like one of those souvenirs, bound in gold vellum, enriched with delicate engravings on thick hot ... pressed \u00b7paper, fit for the hands of ladies and princes, but with nothing in it worth reading or remembering. A severe decorum rules the court and the cottage. When ThaI .. berg the pianist was one evening performing before the Queen at Windsor, in a private party, the Queen accompanied him with her voice. The circumstance took air, and all England shud- dered from sea to sea. The indecorum was never repeated. Cold, repressive manners prevail. No enthusiasm is permitted except at the opera ..

The indecorum was never repeated. Cold, repressive manners prevail. No enthusiasm is permitted except at the opera .. They avoid every thing marked. They require a tone of voice that excites no attention in the room. Sir Philip Sidney is one of the patron saints of England, of whom Wotton aaid, \"His wit was the measure of congruity .. \" Pretension and vaporing are once for all distasteful. They keep ENGLISH TRAITS to the other e~treme of low tone in dress and manners. They avoid pretension and go right to the heart of the thing. They hate nonsense, sentimentalism and high-flown expression; they use a studied plainness. Even Brummel, their fop, was marked by the severest simplicity in dress. They value themselves on the ab\" sence of every thing theatrical in the public business, and OD conciseness and goin~ to the point, in private affairs. In an aristocratical country like England, not the Trial by Jury, but the dinner, is the capital institution. It is the mode of doing honor to a stranger, to invite him to eat-and has been for many hundred years. \"And they think,\" says the Venetian traveller of 1500, \"no greater honor can be conferred or received, than to invite others to eat with them, or to be invited themselves, and they would sooner give five or six ducats to provide an entertainment for a person, than a groat to assist him in any distress.\" It is reserved to the end of the day, the family-bour being generally six, in London, and if any company is expected, one or two hours later. Everyone dresses for dinner, in his own", "to provide an entertainment for a person, than a groat to assist him in any distress.\" It is reserved to the end of the day, the family-bour being generally six, in London, and if any company is expected, one or two hours later. Everyone dresses for dinner, in his own house, or in another man's. The guests are expected to arrive within half an hour of the time fixed by card of invitation, and nothing but death or mutilation is permitted to detain them. The English dinner is precisely the model on which our own are constructed in the Atlantic cities. The company sit one or two hours before the ladies leave the table. The gentlemen remain over their wine an hour longer, and rejoin the ladies in the drawing ... room and take coffee. The dress-dinner generates a talent of table-talk which reaches great perfection: the stories are so good that one is sure they must have been often told before? to have got such happy turns. Hither come all manner of clever projects, bits of popular science, of practical intervention, of miscellaneous humor; political, literary and personal news; rail ... roads, horses, diamonds, agriculture, horticulture, piscicultur(' and wine. English stories, bon mots and the recorded table-talk of theh' wits, are as good as the best of the French\" In America, we art1! apt scholars, but have not yet attained the same perfection: for the range of nations from which London draws, and the sterp ENGLISH T'RAITS contrasts of condition, create the picturesque in society, a~ broken country makes picturesque landscape; whilst our prevail- ing equality makes a prairie tameness: and secondly, because the usage of a dress-dinner every day at dark has a tendency to hive and produce to advantage every thing good.

Much attrition has worn every sentence into a bullet. Also one meets now and then with polished men who know every thing, have tried every thing, and can do every thing, and are quite superior to letters and :science. What could they not, if only they would? CHAPTER VII TRUTH fHE Teutonic tribes have a national singleness of heart, which contrasts with the Latin races. The German name has a pro .. verbial significance of sincerity and honest meaning. The arts bear testimony to it. The faces of clergy and laity in old sculp .. tures and illuminated missals are charged with earnest belief. Add to this hereditary rectitude the punctuality and precise dealing which commerce creates, and you have the English truth lind credit .. The government strictly performs its engagements. 'The subjects do not understand trifling on its part. When any breach of promise occurred, in the old days of prerogative, it was resented by the people as an intolerable grievance. And in mod- em times, any slipperiness in the government of political faith, or any repudiation or crookedness in matters of finance, would bring the whole nation to a committee of inquiry and reform. Private men keep their promises, never so trivial. Down goes the flying word on the tablets, and is indelible as Domesday Book. Their practical power rests on their national sincerity. Veracity derives from instinct, and marks superiority in organization. Nature has endowed some animals with cunning, as a compen- sation for strength withheld; but it has provoked the", "Down goes the flying word on the tablets, and is indelible as Domesday Book. Their practical power rests on their national sincerity. Veracity derives from instinct, and marks superiority in organization. Nature has endowed some animals with cunning, as a compen- sation for strength withheld; but it has provoked the malice of all others, as if ave:qgers of public wrong. In the nobler kinds. where strength could be afforded, her races are loyal to truth, as truth is the foundation of the social state. Beasts that make ENGLISH TRAITS 585 no truce with man, do not break faith with each other. 'T is said that the wolf, who makes a cache of his prey and brings his fellows with him to the spot, if, on digging, it is not found, is instantly and unresistingly torn in pieces. English veracity seems to result on a sounder animal structure, as if they could afford it. They are blunt in saying what they think, sparing of promises, and they require plain dealing of others. We will not have to do with a man in a mask. Let us know the truth. Draw a straight line, hit whom and where it will. Alfred, whom the affection of the nation makes the type of their race, is called by a writer at the Norman Conquest, the truth-speaker; Alueredus veridicus. Geoffrey of Monmouth says of King Aurelius, uncle of Arthur .. that \"above all things he hated a lie.\" The Northman Guttorm said to King Olaf, \"It is royal work to fulfil royal words.\" The mottoes of their families are monitory proverbs, as, Fare jac- Say, do-of the Fairfaxes; Say and seal, of the house of Fiennes; Vero nil verius, of the De 'Teres. To be king of their word is their pride. \\Vhen they unmask", "\"It is royal work to fulfil royal words.\" The mottoes of their families are monitory proverbs, as, Fare jac- Say, do-of the Fairfaxes; Say and seal, of the house of Fiennes; Vero nil verius, of the De 'Teres. To be king of their word is their pride. \\Vhen they unmask cant, they say, \"The English of this is,\" etc.; and to give the lie is the extreme insult. The phrase of the lowest of the people is (Chonor-bright,\" and their vulgar praise, \"J-lis word is as good as his bond.\" They hate shuffling and equivocation, and the cause is damaged in the public opin .. ion, on which any paltering can be fixed. Even Lord Chesterfield, with his French breeding, when he came to define a gentleman, declared that truth made his distinction; and nothing ever spoken by him would find so hearty a suffrage from his nation. The Duke of Wellington, who ha.d the best right to say so, advises the French General Kellermann that he may rely on the parole of an English officer. The English, of all classes, value thelnselves on this trait, as distinguishing them from the French, who, in the popular belief, are more polite than true. An Englishman understates, avoids the superlative, checks himself in compli .. ments, alleging that 1n the French language one cannot speak without lying. They love reality in wealth, power, hospitality, and do not easily learn to Inake a show, and take the world as it goes. They are not fond of ornaments, and if they wear them, they must be 586 ENGLISH TRAITS gems. They read gladly in old Fuller that a lady in the reign of Elizabeth \"would have as patiently digested a lie, as the wearing of false stones or pendants of counterfeit pearl.\" They have", "not fond of ornaments, and if they wear them, they must be 586 ENGLISH TRAITS gems. They read gladly in old Fuller that a lady in the reign of Elizabeth \"would have as patiently digested a lie, as the wearing of false stones or pendants of counterfeit pearl.\" They have the earth-hunger, or preference for property in land, which is said to marl{ the Teutonic nations. They build of stone: public and private buildings are massive and durable. In comparing their ships' houses and public offices with the American, it is com- monly said that they spend a pound where we spend a dollar. Plain rich clothes, plain rich equipage, plain rich finish through- out their house and belongings mark the English truth. They confide in each other-English believes in English. The French feel the superiority of this probity. The Englishman is not springing a trap for his admiration, but is honestly minding his business. The Frenchman is vain. Madame de Stael says that the English irritated Napoleon, mainly because they have found out how to unite success with honesty. She was not aware how wide an application her foreign readers would give to the remark. Wellington discovered the ruin of Bonaparte's affairs, by his own probity. He augured ill of the empire as soon as he saw that it was mendacious and lived by war. If war do not bring in its sequel new trade, better agriculture and manufactures, but only games, fireworks and spectacles-no prosperity could sup- port it; much less a nation decimated for conscripts and out of pocket, like France. So he drudged for years on his military . works at Lisbon, and from this base at last extended his gigantic lines to Waterloo, believing in his countrymen and their syllo- gisms above all the rhodomontade", "it; much less a nation decimated for conscripts and out of pocket, like France. So he drudged for years on his military . works at Lisbon, and from this base at last extended his gigantic lines to Waterloo, believing in his countrymen and their syllo- gisms above all the rhodomontade of Europe. At a St. George's festival, in Montreal, where I happened to be a guest since my return home, I observed that the chairman complimented his compatriots, by saying, \"they confided that wherever they met an Englishman, they found a man who would speak the truth.\" And one cannot think this festival fruitless, if, allover the world, on the 23d of April, wherever two or three English are found, they meet to encourage each other in the nationality of veracity. In the power of saying rude truth, sometimes in the lion's mouth, no men surpass them. On the king's birthday, when each ENGLISH TRAITS bishop was expected to offer the king a purse of gold, Latimer gave Henry VIII a copy of the Vulgate, with a mark at the passage, \"Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge\"; and they so honor stoutness in each other that the king passed it over. They are tenacious of their belief and cannot easily change their opinions to suit the hour. They are like ships with too much head on to come quickly about, nor will prosperity or even adversity be allowed to shake their habitual view of conduct. Whilst I was in London, M. Guizot arrived there on his escape from Paris, in February, 1848. Many private friends called on him. His name was immediately proposed as an honorary mem- ber of the Athenreum. M. Guizot was blackballed. Certainly they knew the distinction of his name. But the Englishman is nol fickle. He", "M. Guizot arrived there on his escape from Paris, in February, 1848. Many private friends called on him. His name was immediately proposed as an honorary mem- ber of the Athenreum. M. Guizot was blackballed. Certainly they knew the distinction of his name. But the Englishman is nol fickle. He had really made up his mind now for years as he read his newspaper, to bate and despise M. Guizot; and the altered position of the man as an illustrious exile and a guest in the country, makes no difference to him, as it would instantly to an American. They require the same adherence, thorough conviction and reality, in public men. It is the want of character which makes the low reputation of the Irish members. \"See them,\" they said, \"one hundred and twenty ... seven all voting like sheep, never pro- posing any thing, and all but four voting the income tax\"- which was an ill-judged concession of the government, relieving Irish property from the burdens charged on English. They have a horror of adventurers in or out of Parliament. The ruling passion of Englishmen in these days is a terror of humbug. In the same proportion they value honesty, stoutness, and ad- herence to your own. They like a man committed to his objects. They hate the French, as frivolous; they hate the Irish, as aim- less; they hate the Germans, as professors. In February, 1848, I they said, Look, the French king and his party fell for want of a shot; they had not conscience to shoot, so entirely was the pith and heart of monarchy eaten out. They attack their own politicians every day, on the same grounds, as adventurers.

The barrister refuses the silk gown of Queen's Coun- ~el, if his junior have it one day earlier. Lord Collingwood would not accept his medal for victory on 14 February, 1797, if he did not receive one for victory on 1st June, 1794; and the long withholden medal was accorded. When Castlereagh dissuaded Lord Wellington from going to the king's levee until the unpopu- lar Cintra business had been explained, he replied, \"You furnish me a reason for going .. I will go to this, or I will never go to a king's levee.\" The radical mob at Oxford cried after the tory Lord Eldon, \"There's old Eldon; cheer him; he never ratted .. \" They have given the parliamentary nickname of Trimmers to the timeservers, whom English character does not love. They are very liable in their politics to extraordinary delu .. sians; thus to believe what stands recorded in the gravest books, that the movement of 10 April, 1848, was urged or assisted by foreigners: which, to be sure, is paralleled by the democratic whimsy in this country which I have noticed to be shared by men sane on other points, that the English are at the bottom of the agitation of slavery, in American politics: and then again by the French popular legends on the subject of perfidious Albion. But suspicion will make fools of nations as of citizens.

But suspicion will make fools of nations as of citizens. A slow temperament makes them less rapid and ready than other countrymen, and has given occasion to the observation that English wit comes afterwards-which the French denote as esprit d'escalier. This dulness makes their attachment to home and their adherence in all foreign countries to home habits. The Englishman who visits Mount Etna will carry his tea-kettle to the top_ The old Italian author of the \"Relation of England\" , (in 1500), says, \"I have it on the best information, that, when the war is actually ranging most furiously, they will seek for good eating and all their other comforts, without thinking what harm might befall them.\" Then their eyes seem to be set at the : bottom of a tunnel, and they affirm the one small fact they know, \u00b7with the best faith in the world that nothing else exists. And as \u00b7their own belief in guineas is perfect, they readily, on all occa .. sians, apply the pecuniary argument as final. Thu~ when the Rochester rappings began to be heard of in England, a man ENGLISH TRAITS 589 deposited \u00a3100 in a sealed box in the Dublin Bank, and then advertised in the newspapers to all somnambulists, mesmer- izers and others, that whoever could tell him the number of his note should have the money. He let it lie there six months, tbe newspapers now and then, at his instance, stimulating the atten- tion of the adepts; but none could ever tell him; and he said, \"N ow let me never be bothered more with this proven lie.\" It is told of", "have the money. He let it lie there six months, tbe newspapers now and then, at his instance, stimulating the atten- tion of the adepts; but none could ever tell him; and he said, \"N ow let me never be bothered more with this proven lie.\" It is told of a good Sir John that he heard a case stated by counsel, and made up his mind; then the counsel for the other side taking their turn to speak, he found himself so unsettled and perplexed that he exclaimed, \"So help me Godl I will never listen to evi- dence again.\" Any number of delightful examples of this English stolidity are the anecdotes of Europe. I knew a very worthy man-a magistrate, I believe he was, in the town of Derby- who went to the opera to see Malibran. In one scene, the heroine was to rush across a ruined bridge. Mr. B. arose and mildly yet firmly called the attention of the audience and the performers to the fact that, in his judgment, the bridge was unsafe! This English stolidity contrasts with French wit and tact. The French, it is commonly said, have greatly more influence in Europe than the English. Wh!it influence the English have is by brute force of wealth and power; that of the French by affinity and talent. The Italian is subtle, the Spaniard treacherous: tortures, it is said, could never wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a- secret. None of these traits belong to the Englishman. His choler and conceit force everything out. Defoe, who knew his country men well, says of them- \"In close intrigue, their faculty's but weak, For generally whate7er they know, they speak., And often their own counsels undermine By mere infirmity without design; From whence, the learned say,", "to the Englishman.

Defoe, who knew his country men well, says of them- \"In close intrigue, their faculty's but weak, For generally whate7er they know, they speak., And often their own counsels undermine By mere infirmity without design; From whence, the learned say, it doth proceed, That English treasons never can succeed; For they're so open-hearted, you may know ThP;r (\\wn mnc:t c:prrpt thOllght~_ ann others' too.\" 590 ENGLISH TRAITS CHAPTER VIII CHARACTER THE Ei\"gli~h race are reputed morose. I do not know that they have sadder brows than their neighbors of northern climates. They are sad by comparison with the singing and dancing na- tions: not sadder, but slow and staid, as finding their joys at home. They, too, believe that where there is no enjoyment of life there can be no vigor and art in speech or thought; that your merry heart goes all the way, your sad one tires in a mile. This trait of gloom has been fixed on them by French travellers, who, from Froissart, Voltaire, Le Sage, Mirabeau, down to the lively journalists of the feuilletons, have spent their wit on the solemnity of their neighbors. The French say, gay conversation is unknown in their island. The Englishman finds no relief from reflection, except in reflection. When he wishes for amusement, he goes to work. His hilarity is like an attack of fever. Religion, the theatre and the reading the books of his country all feed and increase his natural melancholy_ The police does not interfere with public diversions. It thinks itself bound in duty to respect the pleasures and rare gayety of this inconsolable nation; and their well-known courage is entirely attributable to their disgust of life.

It thinks itself bound in duty to respect the pleasures and rare gayety of this inconsolable nation; and their well-known courage is entirely attributable to their disgust of life. I suppose their gravity of demeanor and their few words have obtained this reputation. As compared with the Amer- icans, I think. them cheerful and contented. Young people in this country are much more prone to melancholy. The English have a mild aspect and a ringing cheerful voice. They are large ... natured and not so easily amused as the southerners, and are among them as grown people among children, requiring war) or trade, or engineering, or science, instead of frivolous games. They are proud and private, and even if disposed to recreation, will avoid an open garden. They sported sadly; ils s'amusaient tristement, selon la cDutume de leur pays, said Froissart; and I suppose never nation built their party-walls so thick, or their garden-fences so high. Meat and wine produce no effect on ENGLISH TRAITS 591 them. They are just as cold, quiet and composed, at the end, 15 at the beginning of dinner. The reputation of taciturnity they have enjoyed for six or seven hundred years; and a kind of pride in bad public speak ... ing is noted in the House of Commons, as if they were willing to show that they did not live by their tongues, or thougl..t they spoke well enough if they had the tone of gentlemen. In mixed company they shut their mouths. A Yorkshire mill .. owner told me he had ridden more than once all the wa)l from London to Leeds, in the first-class carriage, with the same persons, and no word exchanged. The club-houses were estab- lished to", "had the tone of gentlemen. In mixed company they shut their mouths. A Yorkshire mill .. owner told me he had ridden more than once all the wa)l from London to Leeds, in the first-class carriage, with the same persons, and no word exchanged. The club-houses were estab- lished to cultivate social habits, and it is rare that more than two eat together, and oftenest one eats alone. Was it then a stroke of humor in the serious Swedenborg, or was it only his pitiless logic, that made him shut up the English souls in a heaven by themselves? They are contradictorily described as sour, splenetic and stubborn-and as mild, sweet and sensible. The truth is they have great range and variety of character. Commerce sends abroad multitudes of different classes. The choleric Welshman, the fervid Scot, the bilious resident in the East or West Indies, are wide of the perfect behavior of the educated and dignified man of family. So is the burly farmer; so is the country squire, with his narrow and violent life. In every inn is the Commercial- Room, in which 'travellers,' or bagmen who carry patterns and solicit orders for the manufacturers, are wont to be entertained. It easily happens that this class should characterize England to the foreigner, who meets them on the road and at every pub .. lie house, whilst the gentry avoid the taverns, or seclude them .. selves whilst in them. But these classes are the right English stock, and may fairly show the national qualities, before yet art and education have dealt with them. They are good loverR, good haters, slow but obstinate admirers, and in all things very much steeped in their temperament, like man hardly awaked from deep sleep, which they enjoy_ Their habits and instincts cleave", "may fairly show the national qualities, before yet art and education have dealt with them. They are good loverR, good haters, slow but obstinate admirers, and in all things very much steeped in their temperament, like man hardly awaked from deep sleep, which they enjoy_ Their habits and instincts cleave to nature. They are of the earth, earthy; and of the sea, as the sea-kinds, 592 ENGLISH TRAITS attached to it for what it yields them, and not from any senti. ment. They are full of coarse strength, rude exercise, butcher's meat and sound sleep; and suspect any poetic insinuation or any hint for the conduct of life which reflects on this animal ex- istence, as if somebody were fumbling at the umbilical cord and might stop their supplies. They doubt a man's sound judg .. ment if he does not eat with appetite, and shake their heads if he is particularly chaste. Take them as they come, you shall find in the common people a surly indifference, sometimes gruff .. ness and ill temper; and in minds of more power, magazines of inexhaustible war, challenging. \"The ruggedest hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon the enraged Northumberland.\" They are headstrong believers and defenders of their opinion, and not less resolute in maintaining their whim and perversity. Hezekiah Woodward wrote a book against the Lord's Prayer. And one can believe that Burton, the Anatomist of Melancholy, having predicted from the stars the hour of his death, slipped the knot himself round his own neck, not to falsify his horoscope. Their looks bespeak an invincible stoutness: they have ex- treme difficulty to run away, and will die game. Wellington said of the young coxcombs of the Life .. Guards, delicately brought up, \"But the puppies fight well\"; and", "the knot himself round his own neck, not to falsify his horoscope. Their looks bespeak an invincible stoutness: they have ex- treme difficulty to run away, and will die game. Wellington said of the young coxcombs of the Life .. Guards, delicately brought up, \"But the puppies fight well\"; and Nelson said of his sail- ors, \"They really mind shot no more than peas.\" Of absolute stoutness no nation has more or better examples. They are good at storming redoubts, at boarding frigates, at dying in the last ditch, or any desperate service which has daylight and honor in it; but not, I think, at enduring the rack, or any passive obedience, like jumping off a castle .. roof at the word of a czar. Being both vascular and highly organized, so as to be very sensible of pain; and intellectual, so as to see reason and glory in a matter. Of that constitu.tional force which yields the supplies of the day, they have the more than enough; the excess which creates courage on fortitude, genius in poetry, invention in mechanics, enterprise in trade, magnificence in wealth, splendor ENGLISH TRAITS 593 in ceremonies, petulance and projects in youth. The young men have a rude health which runs into peccant humors. They drink brandy like water, cannot expend their quantities of waste strength on riding, hunting, swimming and fencing, and run into absurd frolics with the gravity of the Eumenides. They stoutly carry into every nook and corner of the earth their turbulent sense; leaving no lie uncontradicted; no pretensiop unexamined. They chew hasheesh; cut themselves with poisoneo. creases; swing their hammock in the boughs of the Bohon U pas; taste every poison; . buy every secret; at Naples they put St. J anuarius's blood in an alembic; they saw a", "their turbulent sense; leaving no lie uncontradicted; no pretensiop unexamined.

These travellers are of every class, the best and the worst; and it may easily happen that those of rudest be- havior are taken notice of and remembered. The Saxon melan ... choly in the vulgar rich and poor appears as gushes of ill-humor) which every check exasperates into sarcasnl and vituperation. There are n1ultitudes of rude young English who have th~ self-sufficiency and bluntness of their nation, and who, with their disdain of the rest of mankind and with this indigestion and choler, have made the English traveller a proverb fOl uncomfortable and offensive manners. It was no bad descrip .. tion of the Briton generically, what was said two hundred year~ ago of one particular Oxford scholar: \"He was a very bolt1 man, uttered any thing that came into his rnind, not onl~ among his companions, but in public coffee-houses, and WQul<l often speak his mind of particular persons then accidentally pres. ent, without exanlining the company he was in; for which he was often repriInanded and several times threatened to be kicked and beaten.\" The common'Englishman is prone to forget a cardinal article in t.he bill of social rights, that every man has", "his mind of particular persons then accidentally pres. ent, without exanlining the company he was in; for which he was often repriInanded and several times threatened to be kicked and beaten.\" The common'Englishman is prone to forget a cardinal article in t.he bill of social rights, that every man has a right to his own ears. No man can claim to usurp more than a few cubic 594 ENGLISH TRAITS feet of the audibilities of a public room, or to put upon the company with the loud statement of his crotchets or personalities. But it is in the deep traits of race that the fortunes of nations are written, and however derived-whether a happier tribe or mixture of tribes, the air, or what circumstance that mixed for them the golden mean of temperament-here exists the best stock. in the world, broad-fronted, broad-bottomed, best for depth, range and equability; men of aplomb and reserves, great range and many moods, strong instincts, yet apt for culture; 'war-class as well as clerks; earls ~nd tradesmen; wise minor- ity, as well as foolish majority; abysmal temperament, hiding wells of wrath, and glooms on which no sunshine settles, alter- nated with a common sense and humanity which hold them fast to every piece of cheerful duty; making this temperament a sea to which all storms are superficial; a race to which their fortunes flow, as if they alone had the elastic organization at once fine and robust enough for dominion; as if the burly inexpressive, now mute and contumacious, now fierce and sharp- tongued dragon, which once made the island light with his fiery breath, had bequeathed his ferocity to his conqueror ..

They hide virtues under vices, or the semblance of them. It is the misshapen hairy Scandinavian troll again, who lifts the cart out of the mire, or threshes \"The corn That ten day-laborers could not end,\" but it is done in the dark and with muttered maledictions. He is a churl with a soft place in his heart, whose speech is a brash of bitter waters, but who loves to help you at a pinch. I He says no, and serves you, and your thanks disgust him. Here was lately a cross-grained miser, odd and ugly, resembling in countenance the portrait of Punch with the laugh left out; rich by his own industry; sulking in a lonely house; who never gave a dinner to any man and disdained all courtesies: yet as true a worshipper of beauty in form and color as ever existed, and profusely pouring over the cold mind of his countrymen creations of grace and truth, removing the reproach of sterility ENGLISH TRAITS 595 from English art, catching from their savage climate every fine hint, and importing into their galleries every tint and trait of sunnier cities and skies; making an era in painting; and when he saw that the splendor of one of his pictures in the Exhibition dinlmed his rival's that hung next it, secretly took a brush and blackened his own. rrhey do not wear their heart in their sleeve for daws to peck at.

They have that phlegm or staidness which it is a complin1ent 1.0 disturb. \"Great men,\" said Aristotle, \"are always of a nature originally melancholy.\" 'T is the habit of a mind which attaches to abstractions with a passion which gives vast results. They dare to displease, they do not speak to expecta .. tion. They like the sayers of No, better than the sayers of Yes. Each of them has an opinion which he feels it becomes him to express all the more that it differs from yours. They are meditating opposition. This gravity is inseparable from minds of great resources. There is an English hero superior to the French, the German, the Italian, or the Greek. When he is brought to the strife with fate, he sacrifices a richer material possession, and on more purely metaphysical grounds. He is there with his own consent, face to face with fortune, which he defies. On delib- erate choice and from grounds of character, he has elected his part to live and die for, and dies with grandeur. This race has added new elements to humanity and has a deeper root in the world. They have great range of scale, from ferocity to exquisite refinement. With larger scale, they have great retrieving power. After running each tendency to an extreme, they try another tack with equal heat. More intellectual than other races, when they live with other races they do not take their language, but bestow their own. They subsidize other nations, and are not sub- sidized. They proselyte, and are not proselyted. They assimilate other races to themselves, and are not assimilated.

They proselyte, and are not proselyted. They assimilate other races to themselves, and are not assimilated. The Eng- lish did not calculate the conquest of the Indies. It fell to their character. So they administer, in different parts of the world, the codes of every empire and race; in Canada, old French ENGLISH TRAITS law; in the Mauritius, the Code Napoleon; in the West Indies, the edicts of the Spanish Cortes; in the East Indies, the Laws of Menu; in the Isle of Man, of the Scandanivian Thing; at the Cape of Good Hope, of the old Netherlands; and in the Ionian Islands, the Pandects of Justinian. They are very conscious of their advantageous position in his- tory. England is the lawgiver, the patron, the instructor, the ally. Compare the tone of the French and of the English press; the first querulous, captious, sensitive about English opinion; the English press never timorous about French opinion, but arrogant and contemptuous. They are testy and headstrong through an excess of will and bias; churlish as men sometimes please to be who do not forget a debt, who ask no favors and who will do what they like with their own. With education and intercourse, these asperities wear off and leave the good-will pure .. If anatomy is reformed according to national tendencies, I suppose the spleen will here- after be found in the Englishman, not found in the American, and differencing the one from the other.

I anticipate another anatomical discovery, that this organ will be found to be cortical and caducous; that they are superficially morose, but at last tender-hearted, herein differing from Rome and the Latin na .. tions. Nothing savage, nothing mean resides in the English heart. They are subject to panics of credulity and of rage, but the temper of the nation, however disturbed, settles itself soon and easily, as, in this temperate zone, the sky after whatever storms clears again, and serenity is its normal condition. A saving stupidity masks and protects their perception, as the curtain of the eagle's eye. Our swifter Americans, when they first deal with English, pronounce them stupid; but, later, do them justice as people who wear well, or hide their strength. To understand the power of performance that is in their finest wits, in the patient Newton, or in the versatile transcendent poets, or in the Dugdales, Gibbons, Hallams, Eldons and Peels, one should see how English day ... laborers hold out. High and low, they are of an unctuous texture. There is an adipocere in their constitution, as if they had oil also for their mental wheels ENGLISH TRAITS 597 and could per-form vast amounts of work without damaging themselves, Even the scale of expense on which people live, and to which scholars and professional men conform, proves the tension of their muscle, when vast numbers are found who can each lift this enormous load. I might even add, their daily feasts argue a savage vigor of body. No nation was ever so rich in able men; \"Gentlelnen,\" as Charles I said of Strafford, \"whose abilities might make a prince rather afraid than ashamed in the", "are found who can each lift this enormous load. I might even add, their daily feasts argue a savage vigor of body. No nation was ever so rich in able men; \"Gentlelnen,\" as Charles I said of Strafford, \"whose abilities might make a prince rather afraid than ashamed in the greatest affairs of state; \" men of such temper, that, like Baron Vere, \"had one seen him re .. turning from a victory, he would by his silence have suspected that he had lost the day; and, had he beheld him in a retreat, he would have collected him a conqueror by the cheerfulness of his spirit.\" The following passage from the \"Heimskringla\" might almost stand as a portrait of the modern Englishman-\"Haldor was very stout and strong and remarkably handsome in appear ... ances. King Harold gave him this testimony, that he, among all his men, cared least about doubtful circumstances, whether they betokened danger or pleasure; for whatever turned up, he was never in higher nor in lower spirits, never slept less nor more on account of them, nor ate nor drank but according to his custom. Haldor was not a man of many words, but short in conversation, told his opinion bluntly and was obstinate and hard: and this could not please the king, who had nlany clever people about him, zealous in his service. Haldor remained a short time '\\vith the king, and then came to Iceland, where he took up his abode in Hiardaholt and dwelt in that farm to a very advanced age.\" The national temper, in the civil history, is not flashy or whiffling.

The ~low, deep English mass smoulders with fire\\! which at last sets all its borders in flame. The wrath of London is not French wrath, but has a long memory, and, in its hottest heat, a register and rule. Half their strength they put not forth. They are capable of a sublime resolution, and if hereafter the war of races, often ENGLISH TRAITS predicted, and making itself a war of opinions also (a question of despotism and liberty coming from Eastern Europe), should menace the English civilization, these sea-kings may take once again to their floating castles and fInd a new home and a second millennium of power in their colonies. The stability of England is the security of the 1110dern world. If the English race were as mutable as the French, what reli .. ance? But the English stand for liberty. The conservative, money .. loving, lord-loving English are yet liberty-loving; and so freedom is safe: for they have more personal force than any other people. The nation always resist the immoral action of their government. They think humanely on the affairs of France, of Turkey, of Poland, of Hungary, of Schleswig Holstein, though overborne by the statecraft of the rulers at last. Does the early history of each tribe show the permanent bias, which, though not less potent, is masked as the tribe spreads its activity into colonies, commerce, codes, arts, letters? The early history shows it, as the musician plays the air which he proceeds to conceal in a tempest of variations. In Alfred, in the Northmen, one may read the genius of the English society, 41am.ely that private life is the place of honor. Glory,", "colonies, commerce, codes, arts, letters? The early history shows it, as the musician plays the air which he proceeds to conceal in a tempest of variations. In Alfred, in the Northmen, one may read the genius of the English society, 41am.ely that private life is the place of honor. Glory, a career, and ambition, words familiar to the longitude of Paris, are seldom heard in English speech. Nelson wrote from their hearts his homely telegraph, \"England expects every man to do his duty.\" For actual service, for the dignity of a profession, or to appease diseased or inflamed talent, the army and navy may be entered (the worst boys doing well in the navy); and the civil service in departments where serious official work is done; and they hold in esteem the barrister engaged in the severer studies of the law. But the calm, sound and most British Briton shrinks from public life as charlatanism, and respects an economy founded on agriculture, coal-mines, manufactures or trade, which secures an independence through the creation of real values. They wish neither to command nor obey, but to be kings in their own houses. They are intellectual and deeply enjoy liter- ature; they like well to have the world served up ttl them in ENGLISH TRAITS 599 Jooks, maps, models, and every mode of exact information, and, though not creators in art, they value its refinement. They are ready for leisure, can direct and fill their own day, nor need so much as others the constraint of a necessity.

They choose that welfare which is compatible with the commonwealth, knowing that such alone is stable; as wise merchants prefer investments in the three per cents. CHAPTER IX COCKAYNE THE English are a nation of humorists. Individual right is pushed to the uttermost bound compatible with public order, Property is so perfect that it seems the craft of that race, and not to exist elsewhere. The king cannot step on an acre which the peasant refuses to sell. A testator endows a dog or a rookery, and Europe cannot interfere with his absurdity. Every indi\u00b7\u00b7 vidual has his part~cular way of living, which he pushes to folly, and the decided sympathy of his compatriots is engaged to back up Mr. Crump's whim by statutes and chancellors and horse-guards. There is no freak so ridiculous but some English- man has attempted to immortalize by money and law. British citizenship is as omnipotent as Roman was. Mr. Cockayne is very sensible of this. The pursy man means by freedom the right to do as he pleases, and does wrong in order to feel his freedom, and makes a conscience of persisting in it. He is intensely patriotic, for his country is so small.. His confidence in the power and performance of his nation makes him provokingly incurious about other nations. He dislikes for .. eigners. Swedenborg, who lived much in England, notes \"the 600 ENGLISH TRAITS similitude of", "conscience of persisting in it. He is intensely patriotic, for his country is so small.. His confidence in the power and performance of his nation makes him provokingly incurious about other nations. He dislikes for .. eigners. Swedenborg, who lived much in England, notes \"the 600 ENGLISH TRAITS similitude of minds among the English, in consequence \u00b7of which they contract familiarity with friends who are of that nation, and seldom with others; and they regard foreigners as one looking through a telescope from the top of a palace re- gards those who dwell or wander about out of the city.\" A rnuch older traveller, the Venetian who wrote the \"Relation of England,\" in 1500, says: \"The English are great lovers of themselves and of every thing belonging to thenl. They think that there are no other men than themselves and no other world but England; and whenever they see a handsome foreigner, they say that he looks like an Englishman and it is a great pity he should not be an Englishman; and whenever they par- take of any delicacy with a foreigner, they ask him whether such a thing is made in his country.\" When he adds epithets of praise, his climax is, \"So English\"; and when he wishes to pay you the highest compliment, he says, \"I should not know you from an Englishman.\" France is, by its natural contrast, a kind of blackboard on which English character draws its own traits in chalk. This arrogance habitually exhibits itself in allu- sions to the French. I suppose that all men of English blood in America, Europe or Asia, have a secret feeling of joy that they are not French natives. Mr. Coleridge is said to have given public thanks to God, at the close of a lecture, that", "itself in allu- sions to the French. I suppose that all men of English blood in America, Europe or Asia, have a secret feeling of joy that they are not French natives. Mr. Coleridge is said to have given public thanks to God, at the close of a lecture, that he had defended him from being able to utter a single sentence in the French language. I have found that Englishmen have such a good opinion of England, that the ordinary phrases in all good society, of postponing or disparaging one's own things in talking with a stranger, are seriously mistaken by them for an insuppressible homage to the merits of their nation; and the New Yorker or Pennsylvanian who modestly laments the disadvantage of a new country, log-huts and savages, is surprised by the instant and unfeigned commiseration of the whole company, who plainly account all the world out of Eng- land a heap of rubbish. The same insular limitation pinches his foreign politics. He sticks to his traditions and usages, and, so help him God! he will force his island by-laws down the throat of great countries, ENGLISH TRAITS 60r like India, China, Canada, Australia, and not only so, but impose Wapping on the Congress of Vienna and trample down all nationalities with his ta..~ed boots~ Lord Chatham goes for liberty and no taxation without representation-for that is British law; but not a hobnail shall they dare Inake in America, but buy their nails in England-for that also is British law; and the fact that British commerce was to be re-created by th~ independence of America, took them all by surprise. In short, I am afraid that English nature is so rank and aggressive as to be a little incompatible with every other.

In short, I am afraid that English nature is so rank and aggressive as to be a little incompatible with every other. The world is not wide enough for two. But beyond ihis nationality, it must be admitted, the island offers a daily worship io the old Norse god Brage, celebrated among our Scandinavian forefathers for his eloquence and ma- jestic air. The English have a steady courage that fits them for great attempts and endurance: they have also a petty cour- age, through which every man delights in showing himself for what he is and in doing what he can; so that in all com .. panies, each of them has too good an opinion of himself to imitate anybody. He hides no defect of his form, features, dress, connection, or birthplace, for he thinks every circumstance be- longing to him comes recommended to you. If one of them have a bald, or a red, or a green head, or bow legs, or a scar, or mark, or a paunch, or a squeaking or a raven voice, he has persuaded himself that there is something modish and becoming in it, and that it sits well on him. But nature makes nothing in vain, and this little superfluity of self-regard in the English brain is one of the secrets of their power and history. It sets every man on being and doing what he really is and can. It takes away a dodging, skulking, secondary air, and encourages a frank and manly bearing, so that each man makes the most of hhnself and loses no opportunity for want of pushing. A man's personal defects will commonly have,", "man on being and doing what he really is and can. It takes away a dodging, skulking, secondary air, and encourages a frank and manly bearing, so that each man makes the most of hhnself and loses no opportunity for want of pushing. A man's personal defects will commonly have, with the rest of the world, precisely that imporiance which tlJ.ey have to himself. If he makes light of them, so will other men. We all find in these a convenient metre of character, since a little man would be ruined by the vexation. I remenlber ?! 602 ENGLISH TRAITS shrewd politician, in one of our western cities, told me that ~~he had known several successful statesmen made by their foible.\" And another, an ex-governor of Illinois, said to me, :'1\u00a3 the man knew anything, he would sit in a corner and be modest; but he is such an ignorant peacock that he goes bustling up and down and hits on extraordinary discoveries.\" There is also this benefit in brag, that the speaker is uncon- sciously expressing his own ideal. Humor him by all means, draw it all out and hold him to it. Their culture generally enables the travelled English to avoid any ridiculous extremes of this self-pleasing, and to give it an agreeable air. Then the 'natural disposition is fostered by the respect ~\"hich they find entertained in the world for English ability. It was said of Louis XIV, that his gait and air were becoming enough in so great a monarch, yet would have been ridiculous in another man; so the prestige of the English name warrants a certain confident bearing, which a Frenchman or Belgian could not carry. At all events, they feel themselves at liberty to assume the most extraordinary tone on the subject of", "so great a monarch, yet would have been ridiculous in another man; so the prestige of the English name warrants a certain confident bearing, which a Frenchman or Belgian could not carry. At all events, they feel themselves at liberty to assume the most extraordinary tone on the subject of English merits. An English lady on the Rhine hearing a German speaking of her party as foreigners, exclaimed, \"No, we are not foreign- ers; we are English; it is you that are foreigners.\" They tell you daily in London the story of the Frenchman and English- man who quarrelled. Both were unwilling to fight, but their companions put them up to it; at last it was agreed that they should fight alone, in the dark, and with pistols: the candles were put out, and the Englishman, to make sure not to bit any body, fired up the chimney-and brought down the French- man. They have no curiosity about foreigners, and answer any information you may volunteer with \"Oh, ObI\" until the in- formant makes up his mind that they shall die in their ignorance, for any help he will offer. There are really no limits to this conceit, though brighter men among them make painful efforts to be candid. The habit of brag runs through all classes, from the \"Times\" newspaper through politicians and poets, through Wordsworth, Carlyle, Mill and Sydney Smith, down to the boys of Eton. In ENGLISH TRAITS the gravest treatise on political economy, in a philosophical essay, in books of science, one is surprised by the D10st innocent ex- hibition of unflinching nationality.

In a tract on Corn, a most amiable and accomplished gentleman writes thus: \"Though Britain, according to Bishop Berkeley's idea, were surrounded by a wall of brass ten thousand cubits in height, still she would as far excel the rest of the globe in riches, as she now does both in this secondary quality and in the more important ones of freedom, virtue and science.\" The English dislike the American structure of society, whilst yet trade, mills, public education and Chartism are doing what they can to create in England the same social condition. America is the paradise of the economists; is the favorable exception invariably quoted to the rules of ruin; but when he speaks di- rectly of the Americans the islander forgets his philosophy and remembers his disparaging anecdotes. But this childish patriotism costs something, like all nar\" rawness. The English sway of their colonies has no root of kindness. They govern by their arts and ability; they are more just than kind; and whenever an abatement of their power is felt, they have not conciliated the affection on which to rely. Coarse local distinctions, as those of nation, province or town, are useful in the absence of real ones; but we must not insist on these accidental lines. Individual traits are always triumphing over national ones. There is no fence in metaphys- ics discriminating Greek, or English, or Spanish science. Aesop and Montaigne, Cervantes and Saadi are men of the world; and to wave our own flag at the dinner table or in the Uni ... versity is to carry the boisterous dulness of a fire ... club into a polite circle.

Nature and destiny are always on the watch for our follies. Nature trips us up when we strut; and there are curious examples in history on this very point of national pride. George of Cappadocia, born at Epiphania in Cilicia, was a low parasite who got a lucrative contract to supply the army with bacon. A rogue and informer, he got rich and was forced to run from justice. He saved his money, embraced Arianism, ENGLISH TRAITS collected a library, and got promoted by a faction to the episcopal throne of Alexandria. When Julian came, A.D. 36I, George was dragged to prison; the prison was burst open by the mob and George was lynched, as he deserved. And this precious knave became, in good time, Saint George of England, patron of chivalry, emblem of victory and civility and the pride of the best blood of the modern world. Strange, that the solid truth-speaking Briton should derive from an impostor. Strange, that the New World should have no better luck-that broad America must wear the name of a thief. Amerigo Vespucci, the pickle-dealer at Seville, who went out, in I499, a subaltern with Hojeda, and whose highest naval rank was boatswain's mate in an expedition that never sailed, ~ managed in this lying world to supplant Columbus and baptize half the earth with his own dishonest name. Thus nobody can throw stones.

Thus nobody can throw stones. We are equally badly off in our founders; and the false pickle-dealer is an offset to the false bacon -seller ~ CHAPTER X WEALTH THERE is no country in which so absolute a homage is paid to wealth. In America there is a touch of shame when a man ex- hibits the evidences of large property, as if after all it needed apology. But the Englishman has pure pride in his wealth, and esteems it a final certificate .. A coarse logic rules throughout all English souls-if you have merit, can you not show it by your good clothes and coach and horses? How can a man be a gentle- man without a pipe of wine? Haydon says, \"There is a fierce resolution to make every man live according to the means he possesses.\" There is a mixture of religion in it. They are under the Jewish law, and read with sonorous emphasis that their days shall be long in the land, they shall have sons and daughters, flocks and herds, wine and oil. In exact proportion is the re ... proach of poverty. They do not wish to be represented except by opulent meo. An Englishman who has lost his fortune is sa.id ENGLISH TRAITS 60 5 to have died of a broken heart. The last term of insult is, \"a beggar.\" Nelson said, \"The want of fortune is a crime which I can never get over.\" Sydney Smith said, \"Poverty is in- famous in England.\" And one of their recent writers speaks, in reference to a private and scholastic life, of \"the grave moral deterioration which follows an empty exchequer\" You shall find this sentiment,", "of fortune is a crime which I can never get over.\" Sydney Smith said, \"Poverty is in- famous in England.\" And one of their recent writers speaks, in reference to a private and scholastic life, of \"the grave moral deterioration which follows an empty exchequer\" You shall find this sentiment, if not so frankly put, yet deeply implied in the novels and romances of the present century, and not only in these, but in biography and in the votes of public assemblies, in the tone of the preaching and in the table-talk. I was lately turning over Wood's Athence Oxonienses, and look- ing naturally for another standard in a chronicle of the scholars of Oxford for two hundred years. But I found the two disgraces in that, as in most English books, are, first, disloyalty to Church and State, and second, to be born poor, or to come to poverty. A natural fruit of England is the brutal political economy. Mal- thus finds no cover laid at Nature's table for the laborer's son. In 1809, the majority in Parliament expressed itself by the lan- guage of Mr. Fuller in the House of Commons, \"If you do not like the country, damn you, you can leave it.\" When Sir S. Romilly proposed his bill forbidding parish officers to bind chil ... dren apprentices at a greater distance than forty miles from their home, Peel opposed, and Mr. Wortley said, \"though, in the higher ranks, to cultivate family affections was a good thing, it was not so among the lower orders. Better take them away from those who might deprave them. And it was highly injurious to trade to stop binding to manufacturers, as it must raise the price of labor and of manufactured goods.\" The respect for truth of facts in", "thing, it was not so among the lower orders. Better take them away from those who might deprave them. And it was highly injurious to trade to stop binding to manufacturers, as it must raise the price of labor and of manufactured goods.\" The respect for truth of facts in England is equalled only by the respect for wealth. It is at once the pride of art of the Saxon, as he is a wealth .. maker, and his passion for independence. The Englishman believes that every man must take care of himself, and has himself to thank if he do not mend his condition. To pay their debts is their national point of honor. From the E,xchequer I and the East India House to the huckster's shop, every thing prospers because it is solvent. The British armies are solvent and pay for what they take. The British empire is solvent; for in 606 ENGLISH TRAITS spite of the huge national debt, the valuation mounts. During the war from 1789 to I8I5, whilst they complained that they were taxed within an inch of their lives, and by dint of enormous taxes were subsidizing all the continent against France, the English were growing rich every year faster than any people ever grew before. It is their maxim that the weight of taxes must be calcu- lated, not by what is taken, but by what is left. Solvency is in the ideas and mechanism of an Englishman. The Crystal Palace is not considered honest until it pays; no matter how much con ... venience, beauty, or eclat, it must be self-supporting.

They are contented with slower steamers, as long as they know that swifter boats lose money_ They proceed logically by the double method of labor and thrift. Every household exhibits an exact economy, and nothing of that uncalculated headlong expenditure which families use in America. If they cannot pay, they do not buy; for they have no presumption of better fortunes next year, as our people have; and they say without shame, I cannot afford it. Gentlemen do not hesitate to ride in the second-class cars, or in the second cabin. An economist, or a man who can proportion his means and his ambition, or bring the year round with ex- penditure which eA-presses his character without embarrassing one day of his future, is already a master of life, and a freeman. Lord Burleigh writes to his son that \"one ought never to devote more than two thirds of his income to the ordinary expenses of life, since the extraordinary will be certain to absorb the other third.\" The ambition to create value evokes every kind of ability; gov- ernment becomes a manufacturing corporation, and every house a mill. The headlong bias to utility will let no talent lie in a nap .. kin-if possible will teach spiders to weave silk. stockings. An Englishman, while he eats and drinks no more or not much more than another man, labors three times as many hours in the course of a year as another European; or, his life as a workman is three lives .. He works fast. Everything in England is at a quick pace.

He works fast. Everything in England is at a quick pace. They have reinforced their own productivity by the creation of that marvellous machinery which differences this age from any other age .. ENGLISH TRAITS It is a curious chapter in modern history, the growth of the machine-shop. Six hundred years ago, Roger Bacon explained the precession of the equinoxes, the consequent necessity of the re- form of the calendar; measured the length of the year; invented gunpowder; and announced (as if looking from his lofty cell, over five centuries, into ours) that \"machines can be constructed to drive ships more rapidly than a whole galley of rowers could do; nor would they need anything but a pilot to steer them. Carriages also might be constructed to move with an incredible speed, with~ out the aid of any animal. Finally, it would not be impossible to make machines whichd:>Y means of a suit of wings should fly in the air in the manner of birds.\" But the secret slept with Bacon. The six hundred years have not yet fulfilled his words. Two centuries ago the sawing of timber was done by hand; the carriage wheels ran on wooden axles; the land was tilled by wooden ploughs. And it was to little purpose that they had pit. coal, or that looms were improved, unless Watt and Stephenson had taught them to work force-pumps and power-looms by steam. The great strides were all taken within the last hundred years. The Life of Sir Robert Peel, in his day the model Englishman, very properly has, for a frontispiece, a drawing of the !pinning- jenny, which wove the web of his fortunes.", "them to work force-pumps and power-looms by steam.

Hargreaves invented the spinning-jenny, and died in a workhouse. Arkwright improved the invention, and the machine dispensed with the work of ninety-nine men; that is, one spinner could do as much work as one hundred had done before. The loom was improved further. But the men would sometimes strike for wages and combine against the masters, and, about 1829-30, much fear was felt lest the trade would be drawn away by these interruptions and the emigration of the spinners to Belgium and the United States. Iron and steel are very obedient. Whether it were not possible to make a spinner that would not rebel, nor mutter, nor scowl, nor strike for wages, nor emigrate? At the solicitation of the masters/, after a mob and riot at Staley Bridge, Mr. Roberts of Man .. chester undertook~ to create this peaceful fellow, instead of the quarrelsome fellow God had made. After a few trials, he sue .. ceeded, and in 1830 procured a patent for his self-acting mule; 608 ENGLISH TRAITS a creation, the delight of mill-owners, and \"destined,\" they said, \"to restore order among the industrious classes\"; a machine re- quiring only a child's hand to piece the broken yarns. As Ark .. wright had destroyed don1estic spinning, so Roberts destroyed the factory spinner. The power of machinery in Great Britain, in mills, has been computed to be equal to 600,000,000 men, one man being able by the aid of steam to do the work \"\"vhich r~ .. quired two hundred", "Ark .. wright had destroyed don1estic spinning, so Roberts destroyed the factory spinner.

The production has been commensurate. England already had this laborious race, rich soil, water, wood, coal, iron and favorable climate. Eight hundred years ago commerce had made it rich, and it was recorded, \"England is the richest of all the northern nations.\" The Norman historians recite that \"in 1 067, William carried with him into Normandy, from England, more gold and silver than had ever before been seen in Gaul.\" But when, to this labor and trade and these native resources was added this goblin of steam, with his myriad arms, never tired, working night and day everlastingly, the amassing of property has run out of all figures. It makes the motor of the last ninety years. The steam- pipe has added to her popUlation and wealth the equivalent of four or five Englands. Forty thousand ships are entered in Lloyd's lists. The yield of wheat has gone on from 2,000,000 quarters in the time of the Stuarts, to 13,000,000 in 1854. A thousand million of pounds sterling are said to compose the floating money ri)f comnlerce. In 1848, Lord John Russell stated that the people of this country had laid out \u00a3300,000,000 of capital in railways, in the last four years. But a better measure than these sounding figures is the estimate that there is wealth enough in England to support the entire population in idleness for one year. The wise, versatile, all-giving machinery makes chisels, roads, locomotives, telegraphs. Whitworth divides", "\u00a3300,000,000 of capital in railways, in the last four years. But a better measure than these sounding figures is the estimate that there is wealth enough in England to support the entire population in idleness for one year. The wise, versatile, all-giving machinery makes chisels, roads, locomotives, telegraphs. Whitworth divides a bar to a millionth of an inch. Steam twines huge cannon into wreaths, as easily as it braids straw, and vies with the volcanic forces which twisted the strata. It can clothe shingle mountains with ship-oaks, make sword-blades that will cut gun-barrels in two. In Egypt, it can plant forests, and bring rain after three thousand years. Already it is ruddering the balloon, and the next war will be fought in ENGLISH TRAITS 60 9 the air. But another machine more potent in England than steam is the Bank. It votes an issue of bills, population is stimulated and cities rise; it refuses loans, and emigration empties the coun- try; trade sinks; revolutions break out; kings are dethroned. By these new agents our social system is moulded. By dint of steam and of money, war and commerce are changed. Nations have lost. their old omnipotence; the patriotic tie does not hold. N a .. tions are getting obsolete, we go and live where we will. Steam has enabled nlen to choose what law they will live under. Money makes place for them. The telegraph is a limp band that will hold the Fenris-wolf of war. For now that a telegraph line runs through France and Europe from London, every message it transmits makes stronger by one thread the band which war will have to cut. The introduction of these elements gives new resources to existing proprietors.

The introduction of these elements gives new resources to existing proprietors. A sporting duke may fancy that the state depends on the House of Lords, but the engineer sees that every stroke of the steam-piston gives value to the duke's land, fills it with tenants; doubles, quadruples, centuples the duke's capital, and creates new measures and new necessities for the culture of his children. Of course it draws the nobility into the cOlnpetitionJ as stockholders in the mine, the canal, the railway, in the appH .. cation of steam to agriculture, and sometimes into trade. But it also introduces large classes into the same competition; the old energy of the Norse race arms itself with these magnificent powers; new men prove an overmatch for the land-owner, and the mill buys out the castle. Scandinavian Thor, who once forged his bolts in icy Hecla and built galleys by lonely fiords, in England has advanced with the times, has shorn his beard, enters Parliament, sits down at a desk in the India House and lends Miollnir to Birmingham for a steam-hammer. The creation of wealth in England in the last ninety years is a main fact in modern history. The wealth of London determines prices all over the globe. All things precious, or useful, or alnus- ing, or intoxicating, are sucked into this commerce and floated to London. Some English private fortunes reach, and some exceed a million of dollars a year. A hundred thousand palaces adorn 6IO ENGLISH TRAITS the island ..

Some English private fortunes reach, and some exceed a million of dollars a year. A hundred thousand palaces adorn 6IO ENGLISH TRAITS the island .. All that Can feed the senses and passions, all that can succor the talent or arm the hands of the intelligent middle class, who never spare in what they buy for their own consumption; all that can aid science, gratify taste, or soothe comfort, is in open market. Whatever is excellent and beautiful in civil, rural, or ecclesiastic architecture, in fountain, garden, or grounds- the English noble crosses sea and land to see and to copy at home. The taste and science of thirty peaceful generations; the gardens which Evelyn planted; the temples and pleasure-houses which Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren built; the wood that Gibbons carved; the taste of foreign and domestic artists, Shen- stone, Pope, Brown, Loudon, Paxton-are in the vast auction, and the hereditary principle heaps on the owner of to-day the benefit of ages of owners. The present possessors are to the full as absolute as any of their fathers in choosing and procuring what they like. This comfort and splendor, the breadth of lake and mountain, tillage, pasture and park, sumptuous castle and mod- ern villa-all consist with perfect order. They have no revolu- tions; no horse-guards dictating to the crown; no Parisian pois- sardes and barricades; no mob: but drowsy habitude, daily dress .. dinners, wine and ale and beer and gin and sleep. With this power of creation and this passion for independence, property has reached an ideal perfection. It is felt and treated as the national life-blood. The laws are framed to give property the securest possible basis, and the provisions to lock and transmit it have exercised the cunningest heads in a profession which", "of creation and this passion for independence, property has reached an ideal perfection. It is felt and treated as the national life-blood. The laws are framed to give property the securest possible basis, and the provisions to lock and transmit it have exercised the cunningest heads in a profession which never admits a fool. The rights of property nothing but felony and treason can override. The house is a castle which the king cannot enter. The Bank is a strong box to which the king has no key. Whatever surly sweetness possession can give, is tasted in England to the dregs. Vested rights are awful things, and absolute possession gives the smallest freeholder identity of interest with the duke. High stone fences and padlocked garden-gates an- nounce the absolute will of the owner to be alone. Every whim of exaggerated egotism is put into stone and iron, into silver and gold J with costly deliberation and detail. An Englishman hears that the Queen Dowager wishes to es- ENGLISH TRAITS 6II tablish some claim to put her park paling a rod forward into his grounds, so as to get a coachway and save her a mile to the avenue. Instantly he transforms his paling into stone-masonry, solid as the walls of Cuma, and all Europe cannot prevail on him to sell or compound for an inch of the land. They delight in a freak as the proof of their sovereign freedom. Sir Edward Boynton, at Spic Park at Cadenham, on a precipice of incom ... parable prospect, built a house like a long barn, which had not a window on the prospect side. Strawberry Hill of Horace Walpole, Fonthill Abbey of Mr. Beckford, were freaks; and Newstead Abbey became one in the hands of Lord Byron. But the proudest result of", "precipice of incom ... parable prospect, built a house like a long barn, which had not a window on the prospect side. Strawberry Hill of Horace Walpole, Fonthill Abbey of Mr. Beckford, were freaks; and Newstead Abbey became one in the hands of Lord Byron. But the proudest result of this creation has been the great and refined forces it has put at the disposal of the private citizen. In the social world an Englishman to-day has the best lot. He is a king in a plain coat. He goes with the most powerful protection, keeps the best company, is armed by the best edu- cation, is seconded by wealth; and his English name and acci\u00b7 dents are like a flourish of trumpets announcing him. This, with his quiet style of manners, gives him the power of a sovereign without the inconveniences which belong to that rank. I much prefer the condition of an English gentleman of. the better class to that of any potentate in Europe-whether for travel, or for opportunity of society, or for access to means of science or study, or. for mere comfort and easy healthy relation to people at home. Such as we have seen is the wealth of England; a mighty mass, and made good in whatever details we care to explore. The cause and spring of it is the wealth of temperament in the people. The wonder of Britain is this plenteous nature. Her worthies are ever surrounded by as good men as them- selves; each is a captain a hundred strong, and that wealth of men is represented again in the faculty of each individual- that he has w~.ste strength, power to spare. The English are so rich and seem to have established a tap-root in the bowels of the planet, because", "them- selves; each is a captain a hundred strong, and that wealth of men is represented again in the faculty of each individual- that he has w~.ste strength, power to spare. The English are so rich and seem to have established a tap-root in the bowels of the planet, because they are constitutionally fertile and creative. But a man must keep an eye on his servants, if he would not 612 ENGLISH TRAITS have them rule him .. Man is a shrewd inventor and is ever taking the hint of a new machine from his own structure, adapting some secret of his own anatonlY in iron, wood and leather to some required function in the work of the world. But it is found that the machine unmans the user. What he gains in making cloth, he loses in general power. There should be tern .. perance in nlaking cloth, as well as in eating. A man should not be a silk-worm, nor a nation a tent of caterpillars. The robust rural Saxon degenera tes in the mills to the Leicester stockinger, to the imbecile Manchester spinner-far on the way to be spiders and needles. The incessant repetition of the same hand-work dwarfs the man, robs him of his strength, wit and versatility, to make a pin-polisher, a buckle-maker, or any other specialty; and presently, in a change of industry, whole towns are sacrificed like ant-hills, when the fashion of shoe-strings supersedes buckles, when cotton takes the place of linen, or railways of turnpikes, or when commons are en- closed by landlords. Then society is admonished of the mischief of the division of labor, and that the best political economy is care and culture of men; for in these crises all are ruined ex- cept such as are proper individuals, capable", "railways of turnpikes, or when commons are en- closed by landlords. Then society is admonished of the mischief of the division of labor, and that the best political economy is care and culture of men; for in these crises all are ruined ex- cept such as are proper individuals, capable of thought and of new choice and the application of their talent to new labor .. Then again come in new calamities. England is aghast at the disclosure of her fraud in the adulteration of faod, of drugs and of almost every fabric in her mills and shops; finding that milk will not nourish, nor sugar sweeten, nor bread satisfy, nor pepper bite the tongue, nor glue stick~ In true England all is false and forged. This too is the reaction of machinery, but of the larger machinery of commerce. 'T is not\" I suppose, want of probity, so much as the tyranny of trade, which necessitates a.. perpetual competition of underselling, and that again a per- petual deterioration of the fabric. The machinery has proved, like the balloon, unmanageable, and flies away with the aeronaut. Steam from the first hissed and screamed to warn him; it was dreadful with its explosion, and crushed the engineer. The machinist has wrought and watched .. ' engmeers and firemen without number have been sacrificed in ENGLISH TRAITS 6I3 learning to tame and guide the monster. But harder still it has proved to resist and rule the dragon Money, with his paper wings. Chancellors and Boards of Trade, Pitt, Peel and Rob- inson and their Parliaments and their whole generation adopted false principles, and went to their graves in the belief that they were enriching the country which they were impoverishing~ They congratulated each other on ruinous expedients. It is rare to find", "Chancellors and Boards of Trade, Pitt, Peel and Rob- inson and their Parliaments and their whole generation adopted false principles, and went to their graves in the belief that they were enriching the country which they were impoverishing~ They congratulated each other on ruinous expedients. It is rare to find a merchant who knows why a crisis occurs in trade~ why prices rise or fall, or who knows the mischief of paper ... money. In the culmination of national prosperity, in the annexa- tion of countries; building of ships, depots, towns; in the influx of tons of gold and silver; amid the chuckle of chancellors and financiers, it was found that bread rose to famine prices J that the yeoman was forced to sell his cow and pig, his tools and his acre of land; and the dreadful barometer of the poor\u00b7 rates was touching the point of ruin. The poor-rate was sucking in the solvent classes and forcing an exodus of farmers and mechanics. What befalls from the violence of financial crises, befalls daily in the violence of artificial legislation. Such a wealth has England earned, ever new, bounteous and augmenting. But the question recurs, does she take the step beyond, namely to the wise use, in view of the suprenle wealth ~f nations? We estimate the wisdoln of nations by seeing what they did with their surplus capital. And, in view of these in- juries, some compensation has been attempted in England. A part of the' liloney earned returns to the brain to buy schools, libraries, bishops, astronomers, chemists and artists with; and a part to repair the wrongs of this intemperate weaving, by hospitals, savings-banks, Mechanics' Institutes, public grounds and other charities and amenities.

But the antidotes are fright ... fully inadequate, and the evil requires a deeper cure, which time and a simpler social organization must supply. At present she does not rule her wealth. She is simply a good England, but no divinity, or wise and instructed soul.. She too is in the stream of fate, one victim more in a common catastrophe .. But being in the fault, she has the misfortune of greatness t.~ ENGLISH TRAITS be held as the chief offender. England must be held responsible for the despotism of expense. Her prosperity, the splendor which so much manhood and talent and perseverance has thrown upon vulgar aims, is the very argument of materialism. Her success strengthens the hands of base wealth. Who can propose to youth poverty and wisdom, when mean gain has arrived at the con ... quest of letters and arts; when English success has grown out of the very renunciation of principles, and the dedication to outsides? A civility of trifles, of money and expense, an erudi- tion of sensation takes place, and the putting as many impedi- ments as we can between the man and his objects. Hardly the hravest among them have the manliness to resist it successfully. Hence It has come that not the aims of a manly life, but the means of meeting a certain ponderous expense, is that which is to be considered by a youth in England emerging from his minority. A large family is reckoned a misfortune. And it is a consolation in the death of the young, that a source", "of a manly life, but the means of meeting a certain ponderous expense, is that which is to be considered by a youth in England emerging from his minority. A large family is reckoned a misfortune. And it is a consolation in the death of the young, that a source of expense is closed. CHAPTER XI ARISTOCRACY 'fHE feudal character of the English state, now that it is getting obsolete, glares a little, in contrast with the democratic ten .. dencies. The inequality of power and property shocks republican nerves .. Palaces, halls, villas, walled parks, all over England, rival the splendor of royal seats. Many of the halls, like Haddon or Kedleston, are beautiful desolations. The proprietor never saw them, or never lived in them. Primogeniture built these sumptuous piles, and I suppose it is the sentiment of every traveller, as it was mine, It was well to come ere these were gone. Primogeniture is a cardinal rule of English property and institutions. Laws, customs, manners, the very persons and faces, affirm it. The frame of society is aristocratic, the taste of the people is loyal. The estates, names and manners of the nobles flatter the ENGLISH TRAITS fancy of the people and conciliate the necessary support. In 3pite of broken faith, stolen charters and the devastation oj society by the profligacy of the court, we take sides as '\\Ive read for the loyal England and I(ing Charles's \"return to his right\" with his Cavaliers-knowing what a heartless trifler he is, and what a cre,\\v of God-forsaken robbers they are. The people of England knew as much. But the fair idea of a settled govern- ment connecting itself with heraldic nanles, with the written and oral history of Europe, and, at last, with the Hebrew re- ligion and the", "he is, and what a cre,\\v of God-forsaken robbers they are. The people of England knew as much. But the fair idea of a settled govern- ment connecting itself with heraldic nanles, with the written and oral history of Europe, and, at last, with the Hebrew re- ligion and the oldest traditions of the vvorld, was too pleasing a vision to be shattered by a fevv offensive realities and the pol .. itics of shoe-Inakers and costern10ngers. 1.' .le hopes of the COIn .. moners take the san1e direction with the interest of the patricians. Every D1an who beconles rich buys land and does what he ea\") to fortify the nobility, jnto which he hopes to rise. The Anglican clergy are identified with the aristocracy. Time and la'll have made the joining and moulding perfect in every part. The Cathedrals, the Universities\" the national music, the popular romances, conspire to uphold the heraldry which the current politics of the day are sapping. The taste of the people is con- servative. They are proud of the castles, and of the language and symbol of chivalry. Even the word lord is the luckiest style that is used in any language to designate a patrician The superior education and manners of the nobles reconl111end them to the country. The Norwegian pirate got what he could and held it for hi~ eldest son. The Norlnan noble, who was the Norwegian pirate baptized, did likewise. There was this advantage of 'Vestern over Oriental nobility, that this was recruited fronl below. English history is aristocracy with the doors open. \\Vho has courage and faculty, let him COlne in.

English history is aristocracy with the doors open. \\Vho has courage and faculty, let him COlne in. Of course the terms of admission to this club are hard and high. The selfishness of the nobles comes in aid of the interest of the nation to requir ~ signal merit. I)iracy and war gave place to trade, politics and letters; the war-lord to the law-lord; the law-lord to the mer ... chant and the Inill-owner; but the privilege was kept, wbllst the means of obtaining it were changed. ENGLISH TRAITS The foundations of these families lie deep in NorwegIan exploits by sea and Saxon sturdiness on land. All nobility in its beginnings was somebody's natural superiority. The things these English have done were not done without peril of life, nor without wisdom and conduct; and the first hands, it may be presumed, were often challenged to show their right to their honors, or yield them to better men. \"He that will be a head, let him be a bridge,\" said the Welsh chief Benegridran, when he carried all his men over the river on his back. '(He shall have the book,\" said the mother of Alfred, \"who can read it\"; and Alfred won it by that title: and I make no doubt that feudal tenure was no sinecure, but baron, knight and tenant often had their memories refresbed, in regard to the service by which they held their lands. The De Veres, Bohuns, Mowbrays and Plantagenets were not addicted to contemplation. The Middle Age adorned itself with proofs of manhood and devotion. Of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, the Emperor told Henry V that no Christian king had suc~ another knight for wisdom, nurture and manhood, and caused him to be named, \"Father of curtesie.\" \"Our", "were not addicted to contemplation. The Middle Age adorned itself with proofs of manhood and devotion. Of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, the Emperor told Henry V that no Christian king had suc~ another knight for wisdom, nurture and manhood, and caused him to be named, \"Father of curtesie.\" \"Our success in France,\" says the historian, \"lived and died with him.\" The war-lord earned his honors, and no donation of land was large, as long as it brought the duty of protecting it, bour by hour, against a terrible enemy. In France and in Eng .. land the nobles were, down to a late day, born and bred to war: and the duel, which in peace still held them to the risks of war, diminished the envy that in trading and studious nations would else have pried into their title. They were looked on as men who played high for a great stake. Great estates are not sinecures, if they are to be kept great. A creative economy is the fuel of magnificence. In the same line of Warwick, the successor next but one to Beauchamp was the stout earl of Henry VI and Edward IV. Few esteemed them- selves in the mode, whose heads were not adorned with the black ragged staff, his badge. At his house in London, six oxen were daily eaten at a breakfast, and every tavern was full of his meat, and who had any acquaintance in his family should ENGLISH TRAITS 61:7 have as much boiled and roast as he could carryon a long dagger. The new age brings new qualities intu request; the virtues of pirates gave way to those of planters, merchants, senators ~nd scholars. Comity, social taleut and fine manners, no doubt, have had their part also. I have met somewhere", "much boiled and roast as he could carryon a long dagger. The new age brings new qualities intu request; the virtues of pirates gave way to those of planters, merchants, senators ~nd scholars. Comity, social taleut and fine manners, no doubt, have had their part also. I have met somewhere with a blS- toriette, which, whether more or less true in its particulars, car- ries a general truth. \"How came the Duke of Bedford by his great landed estates? His ancestor having travelled on the con- tinent, a lively, pleasant man, became the companion of a foreign prince wrecked on the Dorsetshire coast, where Mr. Russell lived. The prince recommended him to Henry VIII, who, liking his company, gave him a large share of the plundered church lands.\" The pretence is that the noble is of unbroken descent from the Norman, and has never worked for eight hundred years. But the fact is otherwise. Where is Bohun? where is De Vere? The lawyer, the farmer, the silk-mercer lies perdu under the coronet, and winks to the antiquary to say nothing; especially skilful lawyers, nobody's sons, who did some piece of work at a nice moment for government and were rewarded with ermine. The national tastes of the English do not lead them to the life of the courtier, but to secure the comfort and independence of their homes. The aristocracy are marked by their predilec ... tion for country-life. They are called the county-families. They have often no residence in London and only go thither a short time, during the season, to see the opera; but they concentrate the love and labor of many generations on the building, plant .. ing and decoration of their homesteads. Some of them are too old and too proud to wear titles, or, as", "London and only go thither a short time, during the season, to see the opera; but they concentrate the love and labor of many generations on the building, plant .. ing and decoration of their homesteads. Some of them are too old and too proud to wear titles, or, as Sheridan said of Coke, \"disdain to hide their head in a coronet\"; and some curious examples are cited to show the stability of English families. Their proverb is, that fifty miles from London, a family will last a hundred years; at a hundred miles, two hundred years; and so on; but I doubt that steam, the enemy of time as well as of space, will disturb these ancient rules. Sir Henry WottOD says of the first Duke of Buckingham, \"He was born at BrookebY 618 ENGLISH TRAITS in Leicestershire, where his ancestors had chiefly continued about the space of four hundred years, rather without obscurity, than with any great lustre.\" Wraxall says that in I78I, Lord Surrey, afterwards Duke of Norfolk, told him that when the year I783 should arrive, he meant to give a grand festival to all the de- scendants of the body of Jockey of Norfolk, to mark the day when the dukedom should have remained three hundred years in their house, since its creation by Richard III. Pepys tells us, in writing of an Earl Oxford, in 1666, that the honor had now remained in that name and blood six hundred years. This long descent of families and this cleaving through ages to the sanle spot of ground, captivates the imagination. It has too a connection with the names of the towns and districts of the country .. The names are excellent-an atmosphere of legendary melody spread over the land.

But the English are those \"barbarians\" of Jamblichus, who \"are stable in their manners, and firmly continue to employ the same words, which also are dear to the gods.\" 'T is an old sneer that the Irish peerage drew their names from playbooks. The English lords do not call their lands after their own names, but call themselves after their lands, as if the man represented the country that bred hinl; and they rightly wear the token of the glebe that gave theln birth, suggesting that the tie- is not cut, but that there in London-the crags ENGLISH TRAITS 619 of Argyle, the kail of Cornwall, the downs of Dev0n, the iron of \"Vales, the clays of Stafford are neither forgetting nor", "they rightly wear the token of the glebe that gave theln birth, suggesting that the tie- is not cut, but that there in London-the crags ENGLISH TRAITS 619 of Argyle, the kail of Cornwall, the downs of Dev0n, the iron of \"Vales, the clays of Stafford are neither forgetting nor for- gotten, but know the Ulan who ,vas born by them and who, like the long line of his fathers, has carried that crag, that shore, dale, fen, or woodland, in his blood and manners.

The English tenant would defend his lord to the last extremity.\" The English go to their estates for grandeur. The French live at court, and exile themselves to their estates for economy. As they do not mean to live with their tenants, they do not conciliate then1, but wring from them the last SOlts. Evelyn writes from Blois, in 1644: \"The wolves are here in such nUlnbers, that they often come and take children Qut of the streets; yet will not the Duke, who is sover ... eign here, permit them to be destroyed.\" In evidence of the wealth amassed by ancient families, the traveller is shown the palaces in Piccadilly, Burlington House, Devonshire House,", "such nUlnbers, that they often come and take children Qut of the streets; yet will not the Duke, who is sover ... eign here, permit them to be destroyed.\" In evidence of the wealth amassed by ancient families, the traveller is shown the palaces in Piccadilly, Burlington House, Devonshire House, Lansdowne House in Berkshire Square, and lower down in the city, a fe'\\v noble houRes which still withstaild in all their ampJitude the encroachment of streets.

Stafford House is the noblest palace in London. Northumberland House holds its place by Charing Cross. Chesterfield House renlains in Audley Street. Sian House and Holland House are in the suburbs. But most of the historical houses are masked or lost in the modern 620 ENGLISH TRAITS uses to which trade or charity has converted them. A multitude of town palaces contain inestimable galleries of art. In the country, the size of private estates is more impressive. ~rom Barnard Castle I rode on the highway twenty .. three miles from High Force, a fall of the Tees, towaxds Darlington, past Raby Castle, through the estate of the Duke of Cleveland.

The Duke of Norfolk's park in Sussex is fifteen miles in circuit. An agriculturist bought lately the island of Lewis, in Hebrides, containing 500,000 acres. The posses .. sions of the Earl of Lonsdale gave him eight seats in Parliament. This is the Heptarchy again; and before the Reform of 1832~ one hundred and fifty-four persons sent three hundred and seven members to Parliament. The borough .. mongers governed Eng- land. These large domains are growing larger. The great estates are absorbing the small freeholds. In 1786 the soil of England was owned by 250,000 corporations and proprietors; and in 1822, by 32,000. These broad estates find room in this narrow island. All over England, scattered at short intervals among ship-yards, mills, mines and forges, are the paradises of the nobles, where the livelong repose and refinement are heightened by the contrast with the roar of industry and necessi~y, out of which you have stepped aside. ' I was surprised to observe the very small attendance usually in the House of Lords. Out of five hundred and seventy-three peers, on ordin.ary days only twenty or thirty_ Where are they? I asked. \"At home on their estates, devoured by ennui, or in the Alps, or up the Rhine, in the Harz Mountains, or in Egypt, or in India, on the Ghauts.\" But, with such interests at stake, how can these men afford to neglect them? \"0,\" replied my ENGLISH TRAITS 621 friend, \"why should they work", "estates, devoured by ennui, or in the Alps, or up the Rhine, in the Harz Mountains, or in Egypt, or in India, on the Ghauts.\" But, with such interests at stake, how can these men afford to neglect them? \"0,\" replied my ENGLISH TRAITS 621 friend, \"why should they work for themselves, when every man in England works for them and will suffer before they come to harm?\" The hardest radical instantly uncovers and changes his tone to a lord. It was remarked, on the loth April, 1848 (the day of the Chartist demonstration), that the upper classes were for the first time actively interesting themselves in their own defence, and men of rank were sworn special constables with the rest. \"Besides, why need they sit out the debate? Has not the Duke of Wellington, at this moment, their proxies-the proxies of fifty peers-in his pocket, to vote for them if there be an emergency? \" It is however true that the existence of the House of Peers as a branch of the government entitles them to fill half the Cabinet; and their weight of property and station gives them a virtuaJ nomination of the other half; whilst they have their share in the subordinate offices, as a school of training. This monopoly of political power has given them their intellectual and social emi- nence in Europe. A few law lords and a few political lords take the brunt of public business. In the arlny, the nobility fill a large part of the high commissions, and gi ve to these a tone of expense and splendor and also of exclusiveness.

They have borne their full share of duty and danger in this service, and there are few noble families which have not paid, in some of their menlbers, the debt of life or limb in the sacrifices of the Russian war. For the rest, the nobility have the lead in matters of state and of expense; in questions of taste, in social usages, in convivial and domestic hospitalities. In general, all that is required of them is to sit securely, to preside at public meetings, to countenanee charities and to give the example of that decorum so dear to the British heart. If one asks, in the critical spirit of the day, what service this class have rendered?-uses appear, or they would have perished long ago. Some of these are easily enumerated, others more subtle make a part of unconscious history. Their institution is one step in the progress of society. For a race yields a nobility in some form, however we name the lords, as surely as it yields women. The English nobles are high-spirited, active, educated men, \u00b7 622 ENGLISH TRAITS born to wealth and power, who have run through every country rlnd kept in every country the best company, have seen every secret of art and nature, and, when men of any ability or ambi .. tion, have been consulted in the conduct of every important action. You cannot wield great agencies without lending yourself to them, and when it happens that the spirit of the earl meets his rank and duties, we have the best examples of behavior.

Power of any kind readily appears in the manners; and beneficent power le talent de bien fair'e, gives a Inajesty which cannot be concealed or resisted. These people seem to gain as much as they lose by thei.r posi .. tion. They survey society as from the top of St. Paul's, and if they never hear plain truth from men, they see the best of everything, in every kind, and they see things so grouped and amassed as to infer easily the sum and genius, instead of tedious particulari ties. Their good behavior deserves all its fame, and they have that simplicity and that air of repose which are the finest ornament of greatness. The upper classes have only birth, say the people here, and not thoughts. Yes, but they have manners, and it is wonderful how much talent runs into manners nowhere-and never so much as in England. They have the sense of superiority, the absence of all the ambitious effort which disgusts in the aspiring classes, a pure tone of thought and feeling, and the power to command, among their other luxuries 1 the presence of the most accomplished men in their festive meetings. Loyalty is in the English a sub-religion. They wear the laws as ornaments, and walk by their faith in their painted May-Fair as if among the forms of gods. The economist of 1855 who asks, Of what use are the lords? may learn of Franklin to ask, Of what use is a baby? They have been a social church proper to inspire sentiments mutually honoring the lover and the loved. Politeness is", "as if among the forms of gods. The economist of 1855 who asks, Of what use are the lords? may learn of Franklin to ask, Of what use is a baby? They have been a social church proper to inspire sentiments mutually honoring the lover and the loved. Politeness is the ritual of society, as prayers are of the church, a school of manners, and a gentle blessing to the age in which it grew. 'T is a romance adorning English life with a larger horizon; a midway heaven, fulfilling to their sense their fairy tales and poetry. This, just as far as the breeding of the noble- ENGLISH TRAITS man really made hhn brave, handsome, accomplished and great .. hearted. On general grounds, whatever tends to form nlanners or to finish Inen, has a great value. Everyone who has tasted the delight of friendship will respect every social guard vyhich our manners can establish, tending to secure from the intrusion of frivolous and distasteful people. The jealousy of every class to guard itself is a testimony to the reality they have found in life When a In an once knows that he has done justice to hinlselt, let hhn dismiss all terrors of aristocracy as superstitions, so far as he is concerned. He who keeps the door of a mine, whether of cobalt, or mercury, or nickel, or plumbago, securely knows that the world cannot do without him. Everybody who is real is open and ready for that which is also real. Besides, these are they who make England that strongbox and museum it is; who gather and protect works of art, dragged from amidst burning cities and revolutionary countries, and brought I hither out of all the world.

Besides, these are they who make England that strongbox and museum it is; who gather and protect works of art, dragged from amidst burning cities and revolutionary countries, and brought I hither out of all the world. I look with respect at houses six, seven, eight hundred, or, like Warwick Castle. nine hundred vears old. I pardoned high park-fences, when I saw that besides does and pheasants, these have preserved Arundel marbles; Townley galleries, Howard and Spenserian libraries, \\Varwick and Port .. land vases, Saxon manuscripts, monastic architectures, millen .. nial trees, and breeds of cattle elsewhere extinct. In these manors, after the frenzy of war and destruction subsides a little, the antiqu3.ry finds the frailest ROlnan jar or crunlbling Egyptian mummy-case, without so much as a new layer of dust, keeping the series of history unbroken and waiting for its interpreter, who is sure to arrive. These lords are the treasurers and librarians of mankind, enga.ged by their pride and '\\vealth to this function. Yet there were other works for British dukes to do. George Loudon, Quintinye, Evelyn, had taught them to make gardens. Arthur Young, Bakewell and Mechi have nlade theln agricul .. tural. Scotland was a camp until the day of Culloden. The Dukes of Athol, Sutherland, Buccleugh and the IV[arquis of Breaclal- bane have introduced the rape-culture, the sheep-farm, wheat, drainage, the plantation of forests, the artificial replenishment ENGLISH TRAITS of lakes and ponds with fish, the renting of game-preserves. Against the cry of the old tenantry and the sympathetic cry of the English press, they have rooted out and planted anew, and now six millions of people live, and live better, on the same land that fed three millions.

The English barons, in every period, have been grave and great, after the estimate and opinion of their times. The grand old halls scattered up and down in England, are dumb vouchers to the state and broad hospitality of their ancient lords. Shak- speare's portraits of good Duke Humphrey, of Warwick, of Northumberland, of Talbot, were drawn in strict consonance with the traditions. A sketch of the Earl of Shrewsbury, from the pen of Queen Elizabeth's archbishop Parker; Lord Herbert of Cherbury's autobiography; the letters and essays of Sir Philip Sidney; the anecdotes preserved by the antiquaries Ful- ler and Collins; some glimpses at the interiors of noble houses, which we owe to Pepys and Evelyn; the details which Ben Jonson's masques (performed at Kenilworth, Althorpe, Belvoir and other noble houses), record or suggest; down to Aubrey's passages of the life of Hobbes in the house of the Earl of \u2022 Devon, are favorable pictures of a romantic style of manners. Penshurst still shines for us, and its Christmas revels, \"where logs not burn, but men.\" At Wilton House the \"Arcadia\" was written, amidst conversations with Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, a man of no vulgar Inind, as his own poems declare him. I must hold Ludlow Castle an honest house, for which Milton's \"Comus\" was written, and the company nobly bred which per- formed it with knowledge and sympathy. In the roll of nobles are found poets, philosophers, chemists, astronomers, also men of solid virtues and of lofty sentiments; often they have been the friends and patrons of genius and learning, and especially", "\"Comus\" was written, and the company nobly bred which per- formed it with knowledge and sympathy. In the roll of nobles are found poets, philosophers, chemists, astronomers, also men of solid virtues and of lofty sentiments; often they have been the friends and patrons of genius and learning, and especially of the fine arts; and at this moment, almost every great house has its sumptuous picture-gallery. Of course there is another side to this gorgeous show. Every victory was the defeat of a party only less worthy. Castles are proud things, but 't is safest to be outside of them. War is a foul game, and yet war is not the worst part of aristocratic history. ENGLISH TRAITS In later times, when the baron, educated only for war, with his brains paralyzed by hIs stomach, found himself idle at home, hp grew fat and wanton and a sorry brute. Grammont, Pepys and Evelyn show the kennels to which the king and court went in quest of pleasure. Prostitutes taken from the theatres were made duchesses, their bastards dukes and earls. \"The young men sat uppermost, the old serious lords were out of favor.\" The dis ... course that the king's companions had with him was \"poor and frothy.\" No man who valued his head might do what these pot ... companions familiarly did with the king. In logical sequence of these dignified revels, Pepys can tell the beggarly shifts to which the king was reduced, who could not find paper at his council table, and \"no handkerchers\" in his wardrobe, \"and but three bands to his neck,\" and the linen-draper and the stationer were out of pocket and refusing to trust him, and the baker will not bring bread any longer. Meantime the English Channel was swept and London threatened", "at his council table, and \"no handkerchers\" in his wardrobe, \"and but three bands to his neck,\" and the linen-draper and the stationer were out of pocket and refusing to trust him, and the baker will not bring bread any longer. Meantime the English Channel was swept and London threatened by the Dutch fleet, manned too by English sailors, who, having been cheated of their pay for years by the king, enlisted with the enemy_ . The Selwyn correspondence, in the reign of George III, dis- closes a rottenness in the aristocracy which threatened to decom .. pose the state. The sycophancy and sale of votes and honor, fot place and title; lewdness, gaming, smuggling, bribery and cheat\u00b7 ing; the sneer at the childish indiscretion of quarrelling with ten thousand a year; the want of ideas; the splendor of the titles, and the apathy of the nation, are instructive, and make the reader pause and explore the firm bounds which confined these vices to a handful of rich men. In the reign of the Fourth George, things do not seem to have mended, and the rotten debauchee let down from a window by an inclined plane into his coach to take the air, was a scandal to Europe which the ill fame of his queen and of his family did nothing to retrieve. Under the present reign the perfect decorum of the Court is thought to have put a check 011 the gross vices of the aristocracy; yet gaming, racing, drinking and mistresses bring them down, and the democrat can still gather scandals, if he will. Dismal anec- dotes abound, verifying the gossip of the last generation, of dukes 6,,6 ENGLISH TRAITS served by bailiffs, with all their plate in pawn; of great lords living by the showing of their", "drinking and mistresses bring them down, and the democrat can still gather scandals, if he will.

The historic names of the Buckinghams, Beauforts, ~fa(lboroughs and Hertfords have gained no new lustre, and now and then darker scandals break Qut, ominous as the new chapters add,:.d under the Orleans dynasty to the \"Causes Celebres\" in France. Even peers \\i\\Tho are men of worth and public spirit are overtaken and embarrassed by their vast expense. The respect- able l)uke of Devonshire, willing to be the l\\/lrecenas and Lucul- Ius of his island, is reported to have said that he cannot live at Chats\\vorth but one lTIonth in the year. Their many houses eat them up. They cannot sell them, because they are entailed. They will not let them, for pride's sake, but keep them empty, aired, and the grounds mown and dressed, at a cost of four or five thousand pounds a year. The spending is for a great part in aervants, in n1any houses exceeding a hundred. 110st of them are only chargeable \\vith idleness, which, because it squandtrs such vast power of benefit, has the Inischief of crime. \"They Inight be little Providences on earth,\" said Iny friend, \"and they are, for the most part, jockeys and fops.\" Camp- bell says, \"Acquaintance with the nobility, I could never keep up.

It requires a life of idleness, dressing and attendance on their parties.\" I suppose too that a feeling of self-respect is driving cultivated men out of this society, as if the noble were slow to receive the lessons of the times and had not learned to disguise his pride of place. A man of wit, who is also one of the celebrities of wealth and fashion, confessed to his friend that he could 110t enter their houses without being made to feel that they were great lords, and he a low plebeian. ,\\Vith the tribe of artistes, including the musical tribe, the patrician morgue keeps no terms, but excludes them. \"Vhen Julia Grisi and Mario sang at the houses of the Duke of ,,:--ellington and other grandees, a cord was stretched between the singer and the company. vVhen every noble was a soldier, they were carefully bred to great personal prowess. The education of a soldier is a simpler ENGLISH TRAITS affair than that of an earl in the nineteenth century. And this was very seriously pursued; they were expert in every species of equitation, to the most dangerous practices, and this down to the accession of Willialn of Orange. But graver men appear to have trained their sons for civil affairs. Elizabeth extended her thought to the future; and Sir Philip Sidney in his letter to his brother, and Milton and Evelyn, gave plain and hearty counsel. Already too the English noble and squire were preparing for the career of the count.ry-gentleman and his peaceable ex- pense.

Already too the English noble and squire were preparing for the career of the count.ry-gentleman and his peaceable ex- pense. They went from city to city, learning receipts to make perfumes, sweet powders, pomanrlers, antidotes, gathering seeds, gems, coins and divers curiosities, preparing for a private life thereafter, when they should take pleasure in these recreations. All advantages given to absolve the young patrician from in- tellectuallabor are of course mistaken. \"In the university, noble- men are exempted from the public exercises for the degree, etc., by which they attain a degree called honorary. At the same time, the fees they have to pay for matriculation, and on all other occasions, are much higher.\" Fuller records \"the observation of foreigners, that Englishmen, by making their children gentle- men before they are men, cause they are so seldom wise men.\" This cockering justifies Dr. Johnson's bitter apology for primo ... geniture, that \"it makes but one fool in a family.\" The revolution in society has reached this class. The great powers of industrial art have no exclusion of name or blood. The tools of our time, namely steam, ships, printing, money and popular education, belong to those who can handle them; and their effect has been that advantages once confined to men of family are now open to the whole middle class. The road that grandeur levels for his coach, toil can travel in his cart. This is more manifest every day, but I think it is true through ... out English history.

Here at last. were clin1ate and condition friendly to the working faculty. Who now will work and dare, shall rule. This is the charter, or the chartism, which fogs and seas and rains proclaimed-that intellect and personal f'lrce should make the law; that industry and administrati~ ENGLISH TRAITS talent should administer; that work should wear the crown. I know that not this, but something else is pretended. The fiction with which the noble and the bystander equally please themselves is that the former is of unbroken descent from the Norman, and so has never worked for eight hundred years. All the families are new, but the name is old, and they have made a covenant with their memories not to disturb it. But the analysis of the ,peerage and gentry shows the rapid decay and extinction of old 'families, the continual recruiting of these from new blood. The doors, though ostentatiously guarded, are really open, and hence the power of the bribe. All the barriers to rank only whet the thirst and enhance the prize. \"Now,\" said Nelson, when clearing for battle, \"a peerage, or Westminster Abbey!\" \"I have no illu .. sion left,\" said Sydney Smith, \"but the Archbishop of Canter- bury.\" \"The lawyers,\" said Burke, \"are only birds of passage in this House of Commons,\" and then added, with a new figure, \"they have their best bower anchor in the House of Lords.\" Another stride that has been taken appears in the perishing of heraldry.

Whilst the privileges of nobility are passing to the middle class, the badge is discredited and the titles of lordship are getting musty and cumbersome. I wonder that sensible men have not been already impatient of them. They belong, with wigs, powder and scarlet coats, to an earlier age and may be advantageously consigned, with paint and tatoo, to the digni .. taries of Australia and Polynesia. A multitude of English, educated at the universities, bred into their society with manners, ability and the gifts of fortune, are every day confronting the peers on a footing of equality, and outstripping them, as often, in the race of honor and influence. That cultivated class is large and ever enlarging. It is computed that, with titles and without, there are seventy thousand of these people coming and going in London, who make up what is called high society. They cannot shut their eyes to the fact that an untitled nobility possess all the power without the inconveniences that belong to rank, and the rich Englishman goes over the world at the present day, drawing more than all the advantages which the strongest of his kings could command. ~ ENGLISH TRAITS CHAPTER XII UNIVERSITIES OF BRITISH universities, Cambridge has the most illustrious names on its list.

At the present day too, it has the advantage of Oxford, counting in its alumni a greater nun1ber of distin- guished scholars. I regret that I had but a single day wherein to see King's College Chapel, the beautiful lawns and gardens of the colleges, and a few of its gownsmen. But I availed myself of some repeated invitations to Oxford, where I had introductions to Dr. Daubeny, Professor of Botany, and to the Regius Professor of Divinity, as well as to a valued friend, a Fellow of Oriel, and went thither on the last day of March, 1848. I was the guest of Iny friend in Oriel, was housed close upon that coJlege, and I lived on college hospitalities. My new friends showed me their cloisters, the Bodleian Li- brary, the Randolph Gallery, Merton Hall and the rest. I saw several faithful, high-minded young men, some of them in the mood of making sacrifices for peace of mind-a topic, of course, on which I had no counsel to offer. Their affectionate and gre- garious ways reminded me at once of the habits of our Cambridge men, though I imputed to these English an advantage in their secure and polished manners. The halls are rich with oaken wainscoting and ceiling. The pictures of the founders hang from the walls; the tables glitter \\vith plate. A youth came forward to the upper table and pronounced'the ancient form of grace before meals, which, I suppose, has been in use here for ages, Benedictus, benedicat; benedicitur, benedicatur.

It is a courious proof of the English use and wont, or of their good nature, that these young men are locked up every night at nine o'clock, and the porter at each hall is required to give the name of any belated student who is admitted after that hour. Still more descriptive is the fact that out of twelve hundred young men, comprising the most spirited of the aristocracy, a duel has never occurred. Oxford is old, even in England, and conservative. Its founda\" ENGLISH TRAITS tions date from Alfred and even from Arthur, if, as is alleged, the Pheryllt of the Druids had a seminary here. In the reign of Edward I, it is pretended, here were thirty thousand students; and nineteen most noble foundations were then established. Chaucer found it as firm as if it had always stood; and it is, in \"British story, rich with great names, the school of the island and the link of England to the learned of Europe. Hither came Erasmus, with delight, in 1497. Albericus Gentilis, in 1580, was relieved and maintained by the university. Albert Alaskie, a noble Polonian, Prince of Sirad, who visited England to admire the wisdom of Queen Elizabeth, was entertained with stage-plays in the Refectory of Christ-Church in 1583. Isaac Casaubon, com- ing from Henri Quatre of France by invitation of James I, ,vas admitted to Christ-Church, in July, 1613. I saw the Ashlnolean Museum, whither Elias Ashmole in 1682 sent twelve cart-loads ,of rarities.

On every side, Ox- ford is redolent of age and authority. Its gates shut of themselves against modern innovation. It is still governed by the statutes of Archbishop Laud. The books in J\\lerton Library are still chained to the wall. Here, on August 27, I 660, John Milton's Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio and Iconoclastes were committed to the flames. I saw the school-court or quadrangle where, in I683, the Convocation caused the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes to be publicly burnt. I do not know whether this learned body have yet heard of the Declaration of American Independence, or whether the Ptolemaic astronomy does not still bold its ground against the novelties of Copernicus. As many sons, almost so many benefactors. It is usual for a nobleman, or indeed for almost every wealthy student, on quit- ting college to leave behind him some article of plate; and gifts of all values, from a hall or a fellowship or a library, down to a picture or a spoon, are continually accruing, in the course of a ENGLISH TRAITS century. My friend Doctor J. gave me the following anecdote. In Sir Thomas Lawrence's collection at London were the cartoons of Raphael and Michael Angelo. This inestimable prize vvas offered to Oxford University for seven thousand pounds.

This inestimable prize vvas offered to Oxford University for seven thousand pounds. The offer was accepted, and the committee charged with the affair had collected three thousand pounds, when, among other friends, they called on Lord Eldon. Instead of a hundred pounds, he surprised them by putting down his name for three thousand pounds. They told him they should now very easily raise the remainder. \"No,\" he said, \"your men have probably already con- tributed all they can spare; I can as well give the rest:\" and he withdrew his cheque for three thousand, and wrote four thousand pounds. I saw the whole collection in April, J 848. In the Bodleian Library, Dr. Bandinel shoV\\Ted me the manu. ... script Plato, of the date of A.D. 896, brought by Dr. Clarke from Egypt; a manuscript Virgil of the sanle cp.ntury; the first Bible printed at Mentz (I believe in I4 50); and a duplicate of the same, which had been deficient in abollt twenty leaves at the end. But one day, being in Venice, he bought a room full of books and manuscripts-every scrap and fragment-for four thousand louis (l'ors, and had the doors locked and sealed by the consul. On proceeding afterwards to e,aluine his purchase, he found the twenty deficient pages {\\f his J\\ientz Bible, in perfect order; brought them to Oxford witl'l the rest of his purchase, and placed them in the volume; but has too much a,ve for the Provi .. dence that appears in bibliograppy also, to suffer the reunited parts to be re-bound.

Its catalogue is the standard catalop:ue on the desk of every library in Oxford. In ea.ch several collee;e they underscore in red ink on this catalogue the titles of b00ks contained in the library of that college-the theory being that the Bodleian has all books.

They know the use of a tutor, as they know the use of a horse; and they draw the greatest amount of 'benefit out of both.

Seven years' residence is the theoretic period for a master's degree. In point of fact, it has long been three years' residence, and four years more of standing. This \"three years\" is about twenty-one months in all. \"The whole expense,\" says Professor Sewel, \"of ordinary col- lege tuition at Oxford, is about sixteen guineas a year.\" But this plausible statement may deceive a reader unacquainted with the fact that the principal teaching relied on is private tuition.

And the expenses of private tuition are reckoned at from \u00a350 to \u00a370 ,1 year, or $IOOO for the whole course of three years and a half. A.t Cambridge, $750 a year is economical, and $1500 not ex- travagant. The number of students and of residents, the dignity of the luthorities, the value of the foundations, the history and the architecture, the known sympathy of entire Britain in what is done there, justify a dedication to study in the undergraduate such as cannot easily be in America, where his college is half suspected by the Freshman to be insignificant in the scale beside trade and politics. Oxford is a little aristocracy in itself, numer- ous and dignified enough to rank with other estates in the realm; and where fame and secular promotion are to be had for study, and in a direction which has the unanimous respect of all culti- vated nations. This aristocracy, of course, repairs its own losses; fills places, as they fall vacant, from the body of students. The number of fellowships at Oxford is 540, averaging \u00a3200 a year, with lodg- ing and diet at the college. If a young American, loving learning and hindered by poverty, were offered a home, a table, the walk~ and the library in one of these academical palaces, and a thousand dollars a year, as long as he chose to remain a bachelor, he would dance for joy, Yet these young men thus happily placed, and ENGLISH TRAITS paid to read, are impatient of their few checks,", "the walk~ and the library in one of these academical palaces, and a thousand dollars a year, as long as he chose to remain a bachelor, he would dance for joy, Yet these young men thus happily placed, and ENGLISH TRAITS paid to read, are impatient of their few checks, and many of them preparing to resign their fellowships. They shuddered at the prospect of dying a Fellow, and they pointed out to me a paralytic old man, who was assisted into the hall. As the number of undergraduates at Oxford is only about 1200 or 1300, and many of these are never competitors, the chance of a fellowship is very great. The income of the nineteen colleges is conjectured at \u00a3150,000 a year. The effect of this drill is the radical knowledge of Greek and Latin and of mathematics, and the solidity and taste of English criticism. Whatever luck there may be in this or that award, an Eton captain can write Latin longs and short~, can turn the Court-Guide into hexameters, and it is certaiIl that a Senior Classic can quote correctly from the Corpus Poetarum and is critically learned in all the humanities. Greek erudition -exists on the Isis and Cam, whether the Maud man or the Brasenose man be properly ranked or not; the atmosphere is loaded with Greek learning; the whole river has reached a certain height, and kills all that growth of weeds which this Castalian water kills. The English nature takes culture kindly. So Milton thought. I t refines the Norseman. Access to the Greek mind Ii fts hisl, standard of taste.

He has enough to think of, and, unless of an impulsive nature, is indisposed from writing or speaking, by the fulness of his mind and the new severity of his taste. The great silent crowd of thoroughbred Grecians always known to be around him, the English writer cannot ignore. They prune his orations and point his pen. Hence the style and tone of English journalism. The men have learned accuracy and comprehension, logic, and pace, or speed of working. They have bottom, endur- ance, wind. When born with good constitutions, they make those eupeptic studying-mills, the cast-iron men, the dura ilia, whose powers of performance compare with ours as the steam-hammer with the music-bax-Cokes, Mansfields, Seldens and Bentleys, and when it happens that a superior brain puts a rider on this admirable horse we obtain those masters of the world who com\"j bine the highest energy in affairs with a supreme culture. It is contended by those who have been bred at Eton, Harrow, 034 ENGLISH TRAITS Rugby and '\\tVestminster, that the public sentiment within each of those schools is high-toned and nlanly; that, in their play- grounds, courage is universally admired, meanness despised, manly feelings and generous conduct are encouraged: that an unwritten code of honor deals to the spoiled chilrl of rank and to the child of upstart wealth, an even-handed justice, purges their nonsense out of both and does all that can be done to make them gentlemen. Again, at the universities, it is urged that all goes io forr~1 what England values as the flower of its national life-a wtll-educated gentleman.

The race of English gentlemen presents an appearance of manly vigor and form not elsewhere to be found among an equal number of persons. No other nation produces the stock. And in England, it has deteriorated. The university is a decided presulnption in any man's favor. And so eminent are the members that a glance at the calendars ~'I'il1 show that in all the world one cannot be in better company than on the books Df one of the larger Oxford or Cambridge colleges.\" These seminaries are finishing schools for the upper classes, and not f01 the poor. The useful is exploded. The definition of a public school is \"a school which excludes all that could fit a man for standing behind a counter.\" No doubt, the foundations have been perverted. Oxford, which equals in wealth several of the smaller European states, shuts up the lectureships which were made \"public for all men thereunto to have concourse\"; mis-spends the revenues bestowed for such yo~ths \"as should be most meet for towardness, poverty and painfulness\"; tnere is gross favoritism; many chairs and many fellowships are made beds of ease;", "the smaller European states, shuts up the lectureships which were made \"public for all men thereunto to have concourse\"; mis-spends the revenues bestowed for such yo~ths \"as should be most meet for towardness, poverty and painfulness\"; tnere is gross favoritism; many chairs and many fellowships are made beds of ease; and it is likely that the uni .. versit.y -v'll know how to resist and make inoperative the terrors ENGLISH TRAITS of parlialnentary inquiry; no doubt their learning is grown obso .. lete-but Oxford also has its merits, and I found here also proof of the national fidelity and thoroughness. Such knowledge as' they prize they possess and inlpar1.. Whether in course or by indirection, whether by a cramming tutor or by examiners with prizes and foundational scholarships, education, according to the English notion of it, is arrived at. I looked over the Examination Papers of the year I 848, for the various scholarships and fellow..! ships, the Lusby, the Hertford, the Dean-Ireland and the Univer,j sity (copies of which were kinuly given me by a Greek professor), containing the tasks which many competitors had victoriously per formed, and I believed they would prove too severe tests for the candida.tes for a Bachelor's degree in Yale or Harvara. And in general, here was proof of a more searching study in the appointed directions, and the knowledge pretended to be conveyed was conveyed. Oxford sends out yearly twenty or thirty very able men and three or four hundred well-educated men. The diet and rough exercise secure a certain amount of old ,N'orse power.

I should readily concede these advantages, which it would be easy to acquire, if I did not find also that they read better than we, and write better. English wealth falling on their school and university trainingl, makes a systematic reading of the best authors, and to the end of a knowledge how the things whereof they treat really stand: whilst pamphleteer or journalist, reading for an argument for a party, or reading to write, or at all events for sonle by-end iln'\"' posed on th~nl, IDust read meanly and fragmentarily.

It was a certain affirmative or aggres ... sive state of the Caucasian races. Man awoke refreshed by the sleep of ages .. The violence of the northern savages exasperated Christianity into power. It lived by the love of the people. Bishop Wilfrid manumitted two hundred and fifty serfs, whom he found attached to the soil. The clergy obtained respite from labor for the boor on the Sabbath and on church festivals. \"The lord who compelled his boor to labor between sunset on Saturday and sunset on Sunday, forfeited him altogether.\" The priest came out of the people and sympathized with his class. The church was the mediator, check and democratic principle, in Europe. Latimer, Wicliffe, Arundel, Cobham, Antony Parsons, Sir Harry Vane, George Fox, Penn, Bunyan are the democrats, as well as the saints of their times. The Catholic Church, thrown on this toiling, serious people, has made in fourteen centuries a massive system, close fitted to the manners and genius of the country, at once domestical and stately. In the long time, it has blended with everything in heaven above and the earth beneath. It moves through a zodiac of feasts and fasts, names every day of the year, every town and market and headland and monument, and has coupled itself with the almanac, that no court can be held, no field ploughed, no horse shod, without some leave from the church. All maxims of prudence or shop or farm are fixed and dated by the church. Hence its strength in the agricultural dis- tricts. The distribution of land into parishes enforces a church sanction to every civil privilege;", "held, no field ploughed, no horse shod, without some leave from the church. All maxims of prudence or shop or farm are fixed and dated by the church. Hence its strength in the agricultural dis- tricts. The distribution of land into parishes enforces a church sanction to every civil privilege; and the gradation of the clergy -prelates for the rich and curates for the poor-with the fact that a classical education has been secured to the clergyman, makes them \"the link which unites the sequestered peasantry with the intellectual advancement of the age.\" t ENGLISH TRAITS The English Church has many certificates to show of humble effective service in humanizing the people, in cheering and refin- ing men, feeding, healing and educating. It has the seal of Inar'\" tyrs and confessors; the noblest books; a sublime architecture; ~ ritual marked by the same secular merits, nothing cheap or pur .. chasable. From this slow-grown church important reactions proceed; much for culture, n1uch for giving a direction to the nation's affection and will to-day. The carved and pictured chapel-its entire surface animated with image and emblem-made the parish-church a sort of book and Bible to the people's eye. Then, when the Saxon instinct had secured a service in the vernacular tongue, it was the tutor and university of the people .. In York minster, on the day of the enthronization of the new archbishop, I heard the service of evening prayer read and chanted in the choir. It was strange to hear the pretty pastoral of the betrothal of Rebecca and Isaac, in the morning of the world, read with circumstantiality in York n1inster, on the 13th January, 1848, to the decorous English audience, just fresh fron] the Times newspaper and their wine, and listening with all the devotion of national", "hear the pretty pastoral of the betrothal of Rebecca and Isaac, in the morning of the world, read with circumstantiality in York n1inster, on the 13th January, 1848, to the decorous English audience, just fresh fron] the Times newspaper and their wine, and listening with all the devotion of national pride. That was binding old and new to SOlne purpose. The reverence fnr the Scriptures is an element of civilization, for thus has the history of the world been preserved and is preserved. Here in England every day a chapter of Genesis, and a leader in the Times. Another part of the sanle service on this occasion was not insignificant. Handel's coronation anthem, God save the King, was played by Dr. Camidge on the organ, with sublime effect. The minster and the music were made for each other. It was a hint of the part the church plays as a political engine. From his infancy, every Englishman is accustomed to bear daily prayers for the Queen, for the royal family and the Parliament, by name; and this lifelong consecration cannot be without influence on hi~ \u2022 \u2022 opInIons. The universities also are parcel of the ecclesiastical systeln, and their first design is to form the clergy. Thus the clergy for a thousand years have been the scholars of the nation. ENGLISH TRAITS The national temperament deeply enjoys the unbroken order and tradition of its church; the liturgy, ceremony, architecture; the sober grace, the good company, the connection with the throne and with history, which adorn it. And whilst it endears itself thus to nlen of more taste than activity, the stability of the English nation is passionately enlisted to its support, from its inextricable connection with the caU6e of public order, with politics and with the funds.

And whilst it endears itself thus to nlen of more taste than activity, the stability of the English nation is passionately enlisted to its support, from its inextricable connection with the caU6e of public order, with politics and with the funds. Good churches are not built by bad men; at least there must be probity and enthusiasm somewhere in the society. These min .. sters were neither built nor filled bv atheists. No church has had . more learned, industrious or devoted men; plenty of \"clerks and bishops, who, out of their gowns, would turn their backs on no man.\" Their architecture still glows with faith in immortality. Heats and genial periods arrive in history, or, shall we say, plenitudes of Divine Presence, by which high tides are caused in the human spirit, and great virtues and talents appear, as in the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and again in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the nation was full of genius and piety. But the age of the Wiclifies, Cobhams, Arundels, Beckets; of the Latimers, Mores, Cranmers; of the Taylors, Leightons, Her- berts; of the Sherlocks and Butlers, is gone. Silent revolutions in opinion have made it impossible that men like these should return, or find a place in their once sacred stalls. The spirit that dwelt in this church has glided away to animate other activities, and they who come to the old shrines find apes and players rustling the old garments. The religion of England is part of good-breeding. When you see on the continent the well-dressed Englishman come into his ambassador's chapel and put his face for silent prayer into his smooth-brushed hat, you cannot help feeling how much national pride prays with him, and the religion of a gentleman.

When you see on the continent the well-dressed Englishman come into his ambassador's chapel and put his face for silent prayer into his smooth-brushed hat, you cannot help feeling how much national pride prays with him, and the religion of a gentleman. So far is he from attaching any meaning to the words, that he believes himself to have done almost the generous thing, and that it is very condescending in him to pray to God. A great duke said on the occasion of a victory, in the House of Lords, that he thought ENGLISH TRAITS the Almighty God had not been well used by them, and that it would become their magnanimity, after so great successes, to take order that a proper acknowledgment be made. It is the church of the gentry, but it is not the church of the poor. The operatives do not own it, and gentlemen lately testified in the House of Commons that in their lives they never saw a poor man in a ragged coat inside a church. The torpidity on the side of religion of the vigorous English understanding shows how much wit and folly can agree in one brain. Their religion is a quotation; their church is a doll; and any examination is interdicted with screams of terror. In good company you expect them to laugh at the fanaticism of the vulgar; but they do not; they are the vulgar. The English, in common perhaps with Christendom in the nineteenth century, do not respect power, but only performance; value ideas only for an economic result. Wellington esteems a saint only as far as he can be an army chaplain: \"Mr. Briscoll, by his admirable conduct and good sense, got the better of Methodism, which had appeared", "Christendom in the nineteenth century, do not respect power, but only performance; value ideas only for an economic result. Wellington esteems a saint only as far as he can be an army chaplain: \"Mr. Briscoll, by his admirable conduct and good sense, got the better of Methodism, which had appeared anlong the soldiers and once among the officers.\" They value a philosopher as they value an apothecary who brings bark or a drench; and inspiration is only some blow-pipe, or a finer mechanical aid. I suspect that there is in an Englishman's brain a valve that can be closed at pleasure, as an engineer shuts off steam. The most sensible and well-informed men possess the power of thinking just so far as the bishop in reJigious matters, and as the chancellor of the exchequer in politics. They talk with courage and logic, and show you magnificent results, but the same men who have brought free trade or geology to their present standing, look grave and lofty and shut down their valve as soon as the can ... versation approaches the English Church. After that, you talk with a box-turtle. The action of the university, both in what is taught and in the spirit of the place, is directed more on producing an English gentleman, than a saint or a psychologist. It ripens a bishop, and extrudes a philosopher.. I do not know that there is more cabalism in the Anglican than in other churches, but the Anglican ENGLISH TRAITS clergy are identified with the aristocracy. They say here, that if you talk with a clergyman, you are sure to find him well-bred, informed and candid: he entertains your thought or your project with sympathy and praise. But if a second clergyman come in, the sympathy is at an end: tVlO", "are identified with the aristocracy.

But if a second clergyman come in, the sympathy is at an end: tVlO together are inaccessible to your thought, and whenever it comes to action, the c]ergyn1an invari .. ably sides with his church. The Anglican Church is marked by the grace and good sense of its forms, by the manly grace of its clergy. The gospel it preaches is 'By tast.e are ye saved.' It keeps the old structures in repair, spends a world of money in music and building, and in buying Pugin and architectural literature. It has a general good name for amenity and mildness. It is not in ordinary a per- secuting church; it is not inquisitorial, not even inquisitive; is perfectly well-bred, and can shut its eyes on all proper occasions. If you let it alone, it will let you alone. But its instinct is hostile to all change in politics, literature, or social arts. The church has not been the founder of the London University, of the Mechanics' Institutes, of the Free School, of whatever aims at diffusion of knowledge. The Platonists of Oxford are as bitter against this heresy, as Thomas Taylor .. The doctrine of the Old Testament is the religion of England. The first leaf of the New Testament it does not open. It believes in a Providence which does not treat with levity a pound sterling. They are neither transcendentalists nor Christians. They put up no Socratic prayer, much less any saintly prayer for the Queen's mind; ask neither for light nor right, but say bluntly, \"Grant her in health and wealth long", "believes in a Providence which does not treat with levity a pound sterling. They are neither transcendentalists nor Christians. They put up no Socratic prayer, much less any saintly prayer for the Queen's mind; ask neither for light nor right, but say bluntly, \"Grant her in health and wealth long to live.\" And one traces this Jewish prayer in all English private history, from the prayers of King Richard, in Richard of Devizes' Chronicle, to those in the diaries of Sir Samuel Romillyand of Haydon the painter. \"Abroad with my wife,\" writes Pepys piously, \"the first time that ever I rode in my own coach; which do make my heart rejoice and praise God, and pray him to bless it to me, and continue it.\" The bin for the naturalization of the Jews (in 1753) was resisted by peti- tions from all parts of the kingdom, and by petition from the city of London, reprobating this bill, as \"tending extremely to EN3LISH TRAITS the dishonor of the Christian religion, and extremelY injurj(\\us tc the interests and COlnmerce of the kingdom in genrral, and of the city of London in particular.\" But they have not been able to congeal hUlnanity by act of Parlialnent. ~'The heavens journey still and sojourn not,\" and arts, wars, discoveries and opinion go onward at their own pace. The new age has new desires, new enemies, new trades, new charities, and reads the Scriptures with new eyes. The chatter of French polltics, the steam-whistle, the hum of the mill and the noise of embarking emigrants had quite put most of the old legends out of mind; so that when you came to read the liturgy to a modern congregation, it was almost absurd in its unfitness, and suggested a masquerade of old costumes. No chemist has", "of the mill and the noise of embarking emigrants had quite put most of the old legends out of mind; so that when you came to read the liturgy to a modern congregation, it was almost absurd in its unfitness, and suggested a masquerade of old costumes. No chemist has prospered in the attempt to crystallize a reli- gion. It is endogenous, like the skin and other vital organs. A new statement every day. The prophet and apostle knew this, and the nonconformist confutes the conformists, by quoting the texts they must allow. It is the condition of a religion to require religion for its expositor. Prophet and apostle can only be rightly understood by prophet and apostle. The statesman knows that the religious element will not fail, any more than the supply 01 fibrine and chyle; but it is in its nature constructive, and will organize such a church as it wants. The wise legislator will spend. on temples, schools, libraries, colleges, but will shun the enrich- ing of priests. If in any manner he can leave the election and paying of the priest to the people, he will do well. Like the Quakers, he may resist the separation of a class of priests, and. create opportunity and expectation in the society to run to meet natural endowment in this kind. But when wealth accrues to a chaplaincy, a bishopric, or rectorship, it requires moneyed men for its stewards, who will give it another direction than to the. mystics of their day. Of course, money will do after its kind, and will steadily work to unspiritualize and unchurch the people to whom it was bequeathed. The class certain to be excluded from all prefernlent are the religious-and driven to other churchesi which is nature's vis medicatrix. The curates are", "of their day.

Thj, ENGLISH TRAITS abuse draws into the church the children of the nobility and other unfit persons who have a taste for expense. Thus a bishop is only a surpliced merchant. Through his lawn I can see the bright buttons of the shopman's coat glitter. A wealth like that of Durham makes almost a premium 011 felony. Brougham, in a speech in the House of Commons on the Irish elective franchise, said, \"How will the reverend bishops of the other house be able to express their due abhorrence of the crime of perjury, who solemnly declare in the presence of God that when they are called upon to accept a living, perhaps of \u00a34000 a year, at that very instant they are moved by the Holy Ghost to accept the office and administration thereof, and for no other reason what- ever?\" The modes of initiation are more .damaging than custom- house oaths. The Bishop is elected by the Dean and Prebends of the cathedral. The Queen sends these gentlemen a conge d'elire, '.lr leave to elect; but. also sends them the name of the person whom they are to elect. They go into the cathedral, chant and pray and beseech the Holy Ghost to assist them in their choice; and, after these invocations, invariably find that the dictates of the Holy Ghost agree with the recommendations of the Queen. But you must pay for conformity. All goes well as long as you run", "the cathedral, chant and pray and beseech the Holy Ghost to assist them in their choice; and, after these invocations, invariably find that the dictates of the Holy Ghost agree with the recommendations of the Queen. But you must pay for conformity. All goes well as long as you run with conformists. But you, who are an honest man in other particulars, know that there is alive somewhere a man whose honesty reaches to this point also that he shall not kneel to false gods, and on the day when you meet him, you sink into the class of counterfeits. Besides, this succumbing has grave penalties. If you take in a lie, you must take in all that belongs to it. England accepts this ornamented national church, and it glazes the eyes, bloats the flesh, gives the voice a stertorous clang, and clouds the understanding of the receivers. The English Church, undermined by German criticism, had nothing left but tradition; and was led logically back to Roman .. ism. But that was an element which only hot heads could breathe: jn view of the educated class, generally, it was not a fact to front the sun; and the alienation of such men from the church became complete. Nature, to be sure, had her remedy_ Religious persons are ENGLISH TRAITS driven out of the Established Church into sects, which instant1r rise to credit and hold the Establishment in check. Nature has sharper remedies, also. The English, abhorring change in all things, abhorring it most in matters of religion, cling to the last rag of form, and are dreadfully given to cant.

The English (and I wish it were confined to them, but 't is a taint in the Anglo- Saxon blood in both hemispheres)-the English and the Alneri- cans cant beyond all other nations. The French relinquish all that industry to thenl. What is so odious as the polite hows to God, in our books and newspapers? The popular press is flagitious in the exact measure of its sanctimony, and the religion of the day is a theatrical Sinai, where the thunders are supplied by the property-man. The fanaticis111 and hypocrisy create satire. Punch finds an inexhaustible n1aterial. Dickens writes novels on Exeter- Hall humanity. Thackeray exposes the heartless high life. Nature revenges herself more summarily by the heathenism of the lower classes. Lord Shaftesbury calls the poor thieves together and reads sermons to them, and they call it 'gas.' George Borrow summons the Gypsies to hear his discourse on the Hebrews in Egypt, and reads to them the Apostles' Creed in Romany. \"When I had concluded)\" he says, \"I looked around me. The features of the assembly were twisted, and the eyes of all turned upon me with a frightful squint; not an individual present but squint~d; the genteel Pepa, the good-humored Chicharona, the Cosdami, all squinted; the Gypsy jockey squinted worst of all.\" The church at this moment is much to be pitied. She has noth- ing left but possession. If a bishop n1eets an intelligent gentleman and reads fatal interrogations in his eyes, he has no resource but to take wine with him. False position introduces cant, perjury, simony and ever a lower class of mind and character into the clergy: and, when the hierarchy is afraid of", "possession.

The children and laborers use the Saxon unmixed. The Latin unmixed is abandoned to the colleges and Parliament. Mixture is a secret of the English island; and, in their dialect, the male principle is the Saxon, the female, the Latin; and they are combined in every discourse. A good writer, if he has indulged in a Roman roundness, makes haste to chasten and nerve his period by English monosyllables. When the Gothic nations came into Europe they found it lighted with the sun and moon of Hebrew and of Greek genius. The tablets of their brain, long kept in the dark, were finely sensible to the double glory.

The English mind flowered in every faculty. The commonest sense was surprised and inspired. For two centuries England was philosophic, religious, poetic. The mental furniture seemed of larger scale: the memory capacious like the storehouse of the rains. The ardor and endurance of study, the boldness and facility of their mental construction, their fancy and imagination and easy spanning of vast distances of thought, the enterprise or accosting of new subjects, and, gener .. ally, the easy exertion of power-astonish, like the legendary feats of Guy of Warwick. The union of Saxon precision and Oriental soaring, of which Shakspeare is the perfect example, is shared in less degree by the writers of two centuries. I find not only the great masters out of all rivalry and reach, but the whole writing of the time charged with a masculine force and freedom. There is a hygienic simpleness, rough vigor and closeness to the matter in hand even in the second and third class of writers; and, I think, in the common style of the people, as one finds it in the citation of wills, letters and public documents; in proverbs and forms of speech. The more hearty and sturdy expression may indicate that the savageness of the Norseman was not all gone. Their dynamic brains hurled off their words as the revolving 3tone hurls off scraps of grit.

The country gentle .. men had a posset or drink they called October; and the poets, as if by this hint, knew how to distil the whole season into their autumnal verses: and as nature, to pique the more, sometimes works up deformities into beauty in some rare Aspasia or Cleo- patra; and as the Greek art wrought many a vase or column, in which too long or too lithe, or nodes, or pits and flaws are made a beauty of-so these were so quick and vital that they could charm and enrich by mean and vulgar objects. A man must think that age well taught and thoughtful, by which masques and poems, like those of Ben Jonson, full of heroic sentiment in a manly style, were received with favor. The unique fact in literary history, the unsurprised reception of Shakspeare-the reception proved by his making his fortune; and the apathy proved by the absence of all contemporary pane J gyric-seems to demonstrate an elevation in the mind of the people. Judge of the splendor of a nation by the insignificance of great individuals in it. The manner in which they learned Greek and Latin, before our modern facilities were yet ready; without dictionaries, grammars, or indexes, by lectures of a professor, followed by their own searchings-required a more robust mem ... ory, and cooperation of all the faculties; and their scholars, Camden, Usher, Selden, Mede, Gataker, Hooker, Taylor, Bur- ton, Bentley, Brian Walton, acquired the solidity and method of \u2022 engIneers.

The influence of Plato tinges the British genius. Their minds loved analogy; were cognizant of resemblances, and climbers on the staircase of unity. 'T is a very old strife between those who elect to see identity and those who elect to see discrepancies; and it renews itself in Britain. The poets, of course, are of one part; the men of the world, of the other. But Britain had many disci- ples of Plato-J\\iore, Hooker, Bacon, Sidney, Lord Brooke, Herbert, Browne, Donne, Spenser, Chapman, Milton, Crashaw, Norris, Cudworth, Berkeley, Jeremy Taylor. Lord Bacon has the English duality. His centuries of observa- tions on useful science, and his experiments, I suppose, were worth nothing. One hint of Franklin, or Watt, or Dalton, or ENGLISH TRAITS Davy, or anyone who had a talent for experiment, was worth all his lifetime of exquisite trifles. But he drinks of a diviner strealn, and Inarks the influx of idealism into England. Where that goes, is poetry, health and progress. The rules of its genesis or its diffusion are not known. That knowledge, if we had it, would supersede all that we call science of the mind. It seems an affair of race, or of meta-chemistry-the v,tal point being, how Jar the sense of unity, or instinct of seeking resemblances, pre- lominated ..

For wherever the mind takes a step, it is to put itself .Lt one with a larger class, discerned beyond the lesser class with \\vhich it has been conversant .. Hence, all poetry and 8.11 affirma .. tive action comes. Bacon, in the structure of his mind,. held of the analogists, of the idealists, or (as we popularly say, naming from the best example) Platonists. 'Vhoever discredits analogy and requires heaps of facts before any theories can be attempted, bas no poetic power, =3.nd nothing original or beautiful will be produced by hinl. Locke is as surely the influx of decomposition and of prose, as Bacon and the Platonists of growth. The Platonic is the poedc tendency, the so-called scientific is the negative and poisonous. 'T is quite certain that Spenser, Burns, Byron and Wordsworth will be Platonists, and that the dull men will be Lockists. Then politics and commerce will absorb from the edu- cated class men of talents without genius, precisely because such have no resistance. Bacon, capable of ideas, yet devoted to ends, required in his map of the mind, first of all, universality, or prinza philosophia; the receptacle for all such profitable observations and a.\"doms as fall not within the compass of any of the special parts of philoso ... phy, but are more common and of a higher stage. He held this element essential: it is neve1 uut of mind: he never spares rebukes for such as neglect it; believing that no perfect discovery can be made in a flat or level, but you mnst ascend to a higher science. (~If any n1an thinketh philosophy and universality to be idle studies, he doth not consider that all professions are fronl thence ;served and supplied; and this I take to be", "that no perfect discovery can be made in a flat or level, but you mnst ascend to a higher science. (~If any n1an thinketh philosophy and universality to be idle studies, he doth not consider that all professions are fronl thence ;served and supplied; and this I take to be a great cause that has hindered the progression of learning, because these fundamental ENGLISH TRAITS knowledges have been studied but in passage.\" He explained himself by giving various quaint examples of the sumlnary or common laws of which each science has its own illustration. Ht' complains that \"he finds this part of learning very deficient, the profounder sort of wits drawing a bucket now and then for their own use, but the spring-head unvisited. This was the dry light which did scorch and offend most lnen's watery natures.\" PlatG had signifIed the same sense, when he said, \"All the great art3 require a subtle and speculative research into the law of nature, since loftiness of thought and perfect mastery over every subject seem to be derived from sonle such source as this. This Pericles had, in addition to a great natural genius. For, meeting with Anaxagoras, who was a person of this kind, he attached himself to him, and nourished hinlself with sublime speculations on the absolute intelligence; and imported thence into t.he oratorjcal art whatever could be useful to it.\" A few generalizations always circulate in the world, whose authors we do not rightly know, whlch astonish, and appear to b~ avenues to vast kingdc ]TIS of thought, ana these are in the world constants, like the Copernican and Newtonian theories in physics. in England these may be traced usuaily to Shakspeare, Bacon, Milton, or Hooker, even to Van Helmont and Behmen, and do all have a kind of", "to b~ avenues to vast kingdc ]TIS of thought, ana these are in the world constants, like the Copernican and Newtonian theories in physics. in England these may be traced usuaily to Shakspeare, Bacon, Milton, or Hooker, even to Van Helmont and Behmen, and do all have a kind of filial retrospect to Plato and the Greeks. Of this kind is Lord Bacon's sentence, that \"Nature is commanded by obeying her\"; his doctrine of poetry, which \"accommodates the shows of things (0 the desires of the lnind,\" or the Zoroas- trian definition of poetry, Inystical, yet exact, \"apparent pic- tures of unapparent natures\"; Spenser's creed that C~soul is \\ form, and doth the body make\"; the theory of Berkeley, that we I have no certain assurance of the existence of matter; Doctor Samuel Clarke's argument for theism from the nature of space and time; Harrington's political rule that power nlust rest on land-a rule which requires to be liberally interpreted; the theory of Swedenborg, so cosmically applied by hiln, that the man makes his heaven and hell; Hegel's study of civil history, as the conflict of ideas and the victory of the deeper thought; the identity- J?hilosophy of Schelling, couched in the statement that \"aU dif .. ENGLISH TRAITS ference is quantitative.\" So the very announcement of the theory of gravitation, of Kepler's three harmonic laws, and even of Dalton's doctrine of definite proportions, finds a sudden response in the mind, which remains a superior evidence to empirical I demonstrations.

Not these particulars, but the mental plane or the atmosphere from which they emanate was the home and element of the writers and readers in what we loosely call the Elizabethan age (say, in literary history, the period from 157 5 to 1625), yet a period almost short enough to justify Ben Jonson's remark on Lord Bacon-\"About his time, .and within his view, were born all the wits that could honor a llation, or help study.\" Such richness of genius had not existed more than once before. These heights could not be maintained. As we find stuInps of vast trees in our exhausted soils, and have received traditions of their ancient fertility to tillage, so history reckons epochs in which the intellect of famed races became effete. So it fared with English genius. These heights were followed by a meanness and a descent of the mind into lower levels; the loss of wings; no high speCUlation. Locke, to whom the Ineaning of ideas was un- known, became the type of philc'Sophy, and his \"understanding\" the measure, in all nations, of the English intellect. His country- men forsook the lofty sides of Parnassus, on which they had once walked with echoing steps, and disused the studies once so beloved; the powers of thought fell into neglect. The later Eng ... lish want the faculty of Plato and Aristotle, of grouping men in natural classes by an insight of general laws, so deep that the rule is deduced with equal precision from few subjects, or frorrt one, as from multitudes of lives. Shakspeare is supreme in that, as in all the great mental energies. The Germans generalize: the English cannot interpret the German mind.

Shakspeare is supreme in that, as in all the great mental energies. The Germans generalize: the English cannot interpret the German mind. German science com- prehends the English. The absence of the faculty in England is shown by the timidity which accumulates mountains of facts, as a bad general wants myriads of men and Iniles of redoubts p ... , I:ompensate the inspirations of courage and conduct. The English shrink. from a generalization. \"They do not look ~NGLISH TRAITS abroad into universality, or they draw only a bucketful at the fountain of the First Philosophy for their occasion, and do not go to the spring-head.\" Bacon, who said this, is almost unique among his countrymen in that faculty; at least among the prose .. writers. Milton, who was the stair or high table-land to let down the English genius from the summits of Shakspeare, used this privilege sometimes in poetry, more rarely in prose. For a long interval afterwards, it is not found. Burke was addicted to gener- alizing, but his was a shorter line; as his thoughts have less depth, they have less compass. Hume's abstractions are not deep or wise. He owes his fame to one keen observation, that no copula had been detected between any cause and effect, either in physics or in thought; that the term cause and effect was loosely or gratui- tously applied to what we know only as consecutive, not at all as causal. Doctor Johnson's written abstractions have little value; the tone of feeling in them makes their chief worth. Mr. Hallam, a learned and elegant scholar, has written the history of European literature for three centuries-a", "or gratui- tously applied to what we know only as consecutive, not at all as causal. Doctor Johnson's written abstractions have little value; the tone of feeling in them makes their chief worth. Mr. Hallam, a learned and elegant scholar, has written the history of European literature for three centuries-a performance of great ambition, inasmuch as a judgment \\vas to be attempted on every book. But his eye does not reach to the ideal standards: the verdicts are all dated froln London; all new thought must be cast into the old moulds. The expansive element which creates literature is steadily denied. Plato is resisted, and his school. Hallam is uniformly polite, but with deficient synlpathy; writes with resolute generosity, but is unconscious of the deep worth which lies in the mystics, and which often outvalues as a seed of power and a source 0 f revolution all the correct writers and shining reputations of their day_ He passes in silence, or dis- misses with a kind of contempt, the pro founder masters: a lover of ideas is not only uncongenial, but unintelligible. Hallam in- spires respect by his knowledge and fidelity, by his manifest love of good books, and he lifts himself to own better than almost any the gre')~ess of Shakspeare, and better than Johnson he appre\u00b7 ciates MiTton. But in I-fallam, or in the firmer intellectual nervi: of Mackintosh, one still finds the same type of English geniUS. It is wise and rich, but it lives on its capital. It is retrospective. How can it discern and hail the new forms that are looming uy, ENGLISH TRAITS on tbe horizon, new and gigantic thoughts Nhich cannot dress themselves \"Jut of any old wardrobe of the past?

How can it discern and hail the new forms that are looming uy, ENGLISH TRAITS on tbe horizon, new and gigantic thoughts Nhich cannot dress themselves \"Jut of any old wardrobe of the past? The essays, the fiction and the poetry of the day have the like municipal Ihnits. Dickens, with preternatural apprehension of the language of manners and the varieties of street life; with pathos and laughter, wiih patriotic and still enlarging generosity, writes London tracts. He is a painter of English details, like Hogarth; local and temporary in his tints and style, and local in his aims. Bulwer, an industrious writer, with occasional abil- ity, is distinguished for his reverence of intellect as a temporality, and appeals to the worldly ambition of the student. His romances tend to fan these low flames. Their novelists despair of the heart. Thackeray finds that God has made no allowance for the poor thing in his universe-mare's the pity, he thinks-but 't is not for us to be wiser; we must renounce ideals and accept London. The brilliant Macaulay, who expresses the tone of the Eng- lish governing classes of the day, explicitly teaches that gooJ, means good to eat, good to wear, '~llaterial commodity; that the glory of modern philosophy is its direction on \"fruit\"; to yield economical inventions; and that its merit is to avoid ideas and avoid morals. He thinks it the distinctive merit of the Baconian philosophy in its triumph over the old Platonic, its disentangling the intellect from theories of the all-Fair and all-Good, and pin~ ning it down to the making a better sick chair and a better wine .. whey for an invalid-this not ironically, but. in good faith-that, \"solid advantage,\" as he calls it, meaning always sensual benefit, is the", "its disentangling the intellect from theories of the all-Fair and all-Good, and pin~ ning it down to the making a better sick chair and a better wine .. whey for an invalid-this not ironically, but. in good faith-that, \"solid advantage,\" as he calls it, meaning always sensual benefit, is the only good.

The critic hides his skepticism under the English cant of pracdcal. To convince the reason, to touch the conscience, is romblltic pretension. The fine arts fall to the ground. Beauty, except as lu..-xurious commodity, does not exist. , It is very certain, I may say in passing, that if Lord Bacon had been only the sensualist his critic pretends: he would never ENGLISH TRAITS 655 have acquired the fame which now entitles him to this patron .. age. It is because be had imagination, the leisures of the spirit, and basked in an element of contemplation out of all modern English atmospheric gauges, that he is impressive to the imagina .. tions of nlen and has b(!come a potentate not to be ignored. Sir David Brewster sees the high place of Bacon, without finding Newton indebted to him, a,!1d thinks it a misLake.

Coleridge, a catholic mind, with a hunger for ideas; with eyes looking before and after to the highest bards and sages, and who wrote and spoke the only high criticism in his tilne, is one of those who save England from the reproach of no longer pos- sessing the capacity to appreciate what rarest wit the island has yielded. Yet the misfortune of his life, his vast attenlpts but most inadequate performings, failing to accomplish anyone master- piece-seems to mark the closing of an era. Even in him, the traditional Englishman was too strong for the philosopher, and he fell into accommodations,. and as Burke had striven to ideal- ize the English State, so Coleridge 'narrowed his mind' in the attempt to reconcile the Gothic rule and dogn1a of the Anglican Church, with eternal ideas. But for Coleridge, and a lurk.ing taciturn minority uttering itself in occasional criticism, oftener in private discourse, one would say that in Germany and in America is the best mind in England rightly respected. It is the surest sign of national decay, when the Brahmins can no longer read or understand the Brahminical philosophy. In the decomposition and asphyxia that followed all this materialism, Carlyle ,vas driven by his disgust at the pettiness and the cant, into the preaching of Fate. In comparison with all this rottenness, any check, any cleansing, though by fire, seemed desirable and beautiful. He saw little difference in the gladiators, or \"the causes\" for which they combated; the one comfort was, that they were all", "at the pettiness and the cant, into the preaching of Fate. In comparison with all this rottenness, any check, any cleansing, though by fire, seemed desirable and beautiful.

And ~is imaginatjon, finding no nutrin1ent in any crea .. ENGLISH TRAITS tion, avenged itself by celebrating the majestic beauty of the laws of decay. The necessities of mental structure force all minds into a few categories; and where impatience of the tricks of men makes Nemesis amiable, and builds altars to the negative Deity, the inevitable recoil is to heroism or the gal~ lantry of the private heart, which decks its immolation with glory, in the unequal combat of will against fate. Wilkinson, the editor of Swedenborg, the annotator of Fourier and the champion of Hahnemann, has brought to metaphysics and to physiology a native vigor, with a catholic perception of relations, equal to the highest attempts, and a rhetoric like the armory of the invincible knights of old. There is in the action of his mind a long Atlantic roll not known except in deepest waters, and only lacking what ought to accompany such powers, a manifest centrality. If his mind does not rest in immovable biases, perhaps the orbit is larger and the return is not yet: but a master should inspire a confidence that he will adhere to his convictions and give his present studies always the same high place. It would be easy to add exceptions to the limitary tone of English thought, and much more easy to adduce examples of excellence in particular veins; and if, going out of the region of dogma, we pass into that of", "and give his present studies always the same high place. It would be easy to add exceptions to the limitary tone of English thought, and much more easy to adduce examples of excellence in particular veins; and if, going out of the region of dogma, we pass into that of general culture, there is no end to the graces and amenities, wit, sensibility and erudition of the learned class. But the artificial succor which marks all English performance appears in letters also: much of their resthetic pro- duction is antiquarian and manufactured, and literary reputa- tions have been achieved by forcible men, whose relation to literature was purely accidental, but who were driven by tastes and modes they found in vogue into their several careers. So, at this moment, every ambitious young man studies geology: so members of Parliament are made, and churchmen. The bias of Englishmen to practical skill has reacted on the national mind. They are incapable of an inutility, and respect the five mechanic powers even in their song. The voice of their modern muse has a slight hint of the steam~whistle and the . , poem IS created as an ornament and finish of their monarchy, ENGLISH TRAITS 651 and by no means as the bird of a new morning which forget~ the past world in the full enjoyment of that which is forming ..

The tone of colleges and of scholars and of literary society has this mortal air. I seem to walk on a marble floor, where nothing will grow. They exert every variety of talent on a lower ground and may be said to live and act in a sub .. mind. They have lost all com- mand;ng views in literature, philosophy and science. A good Englishman shuts hilnself out of three fourths of his mind and confines himself to one fourth. He has learning, good sense~ power of labor, and logic; but a faith in the laws of the mind like that of Archimedes; a belief like that of Euler and Kepler, that experience must follow and not lead the laws of the mind; a devotion to the theory of politics like that of Hooker and Milton and Harrington, the modern English mind repudiates. I fear the same fault lies in their science, since they have known how to make it repulsive and bereave nature of its charm-though perhaps the complaint flies wider, and the vice attaches to many nlore than to British physicists. The eye of the naturalist must have a scope like nature itself, a suscepti- bility to all impressions, alive to the heart as well as to the logic of creation.

The eye of the naturalist must have a scope like nature itself, a suscepti- bility to all impressions, alive to the heart as well as to the logic of creation. But English science puts humanity to the door. It wants the connection which is the test of genius. The science is false by not being poetic. It isolates the reptile or mollusk it assun1es to explain; whilst reptile or mollusk only exists in system, in relation. The poet only sees it as an inevitable step in the path of the Creator w But, in England, one hermit finds this fact, and another finds that, and lives and dies ENGLISH TRAITS ignorant of its value. There are great exceptions, of John Hun .. ter, a n1an of ideas; perhaps of Robert Brown, the botanist; and of Richard OV'len, who has imported into Britain the German homologies, and enriched science with contributions of his own, adding sometimes the divination of the old masters to the un- broken power of labor in the English rnind. But for the most part the natural science in England is out of its loyal alliance with morals, and is as void of imagination and free play of thought as conveyancing. It stands in strong contrast with the genius of the Germans, those semi-Greeks, who love analogy, and, by Ineans of their height of view, preserve their enthusiasm and thin1{ for Europe.

A horizon of brass of the diameter of his umbrella shuts down around his senses. Squalid contentment with conventions, satire at the names of philosophy and religion, parochial and shop-till politics, and idolatry of llsage, betray the ebb of life and spirit. As they tralnple on nationalities to reproduce London and Londoners in Europe and Asia, so they fear the hostility of ideas, of poetry, of re- ligion-ghosts which they cannot lay; and, having attempted to domesticate and dress the Blessed Soul itself in English broadcloth and gaiters, they are tormented with fear that herein lurks a force that will sweep their system away. The artists say, \"Nature puts them out\"; the scholars have become unideal. They parry earnest speech with banter and levity; they laugh you down, or they change the subject. \"The fact is,\" say they over their vvine, \"all that about liberty, and so forth, is gone by; it won:'t do any longer.\" The practical and comfortable oppress them with inexorable claims, and the smallest fraction of power remains for heroism and poetry. No poet dares murmur of beauty out of the precinct of his rhytnes. No priest dares hint at a Providence which does not respect English utility. The island is a roaring volcano of fate, of material values, of tariffs and laws of repression, glutted markets and low prices. ~1~ GLISR TRAIT~ 659 In the absence of the highest aims, of the pure love of knowl~ edge and the surrender to nature, there is the suppression of the imagination~ the priapism of the senses and the understanding; we have", "tariffs and laws of repression, glutted markets and low prices. ~1~ GLISR TRAIT~ 659 In the absence of the highest aims, of the pure love of knowl~ edge and the surrender to nature, there is the suppression of the imagination~ the priapism of the senses and the understanding; we have the factitious instead of the natural; tasteless expense, arts of comfort, and the rewarding as all illustrious inventor whosoever will contrive one impediIneni more to interpose be- tween the man and his objects. Thus poetry is degraded and nlade ornamental. Pope and his school wrote poetry fit to put round frosted cake. What did Walter Scott write without stint? a rhymed traveller's guide to Scotland. And the libraries of verses they print have this Bir- mingham character. How many volumes of well-bred metre we must jingle through, before we can be filled, taught, renewed! We want the miraculous; the beauty which we can nlanufacture at no nliU-can give no account of; the beauty of which Chaucer and Chapman had the secret. The poetry of course is low and prosaic; only now and then, as in Wordsworth, conscientious; or in Byron, passional; or in Tennyson, factitious. But if I should count the poets who have contributed to the Bible of existing England sentences of guidance and consolation which are still glowing and effective-how few! Shall I find my heav\u00b7 enly bread in the reigning poets? Where is great design in modern English poetry? The English have lost sight of the fact that poetry exists to speak the spiritual law, and that no wealth of description or of fancy is yet essentially new ancl out of the limits of prose, until this condition is reached.

There .. fore the grave old poets, like the Greek artists, heeded theiI designs, and less considered the finish. It was their office to lead to the divine sources, out of vvhich all this, and much more, readily springs; and, if this religion is in the poetry, it raises us to some purpose and we can well afford some staidness or hardness, or want of popular tune in the verses. The exc~ptional fact of the period is the genius of W ords~ worth. He had no master but nature and solitude. \"He wrote a poem,\" says Landor, \"without the aid of war.\" His verse is the voice of sanity in a worldly and ambitious age. One regrets that his temperament was not more liquid and musical. He has written 660 ENGLISH TRAITS longer than he was inspired. But for the rest, he has no com-: petitor. Tennyson is endowed precisely in points where Wordsworth wanted. There is no finer ear, nor more command of the keys of language. Color, like the dawn, flows over the horizon from his pencil, in waves so rich that we do not miss the central form. Through all his refinements, too, he has reached the public -a certificate of good sense and general power, since he who aspires to be the English poet must be as large as London, not in the same kind as London, but in his own kind. But he wants a subject, and climbs no mount of vision to bring its secrets to the people.

But he wants a subject, and climbs no mount of vision to bring its secrets to the people. He contents himself with describing the Englishman as he is, and proposes no better. There are all degrees in poetry and we must be thankful for every beautiful talent. But it is only a first success, when the ear is gained. The best office of the best poets has been to show how low and uninspired was their general style, and that only once or twice they have struck the high chord. That expansiveness which is the essence of the poetic ele- ment, they have not. It was no Oxonian, but Hafiz, who said, \"Let us be crowned with roses, let us drink wine, and break up the tiresome old roof of heaven into new forms.\" A stanza of the song of nature the Oxonian has no ear for, and he does not value the salient and curative influence of intellectual action, studious of truth without a by-end. By the law of contraries, I look for an irresistible taste for Orientalism in Britain. For a self-conceited modish life, made up of trifles, clinging to a corporeal civilization, hating ideas, there is no remedy like the Oriental largeness. That astonishes and dis- concerts English decorum. For once, there is thunder it never heard, light it never saw, and power which trifles with time and space. I am not surprised then to find an Englishman like Warren Hastings, who had been struck with the grand style of thinking in the Indian writings, deprecating the iJrejudices of his countrymen while offering them a translation of the Bhagvat \"1fight I, an unlettered man, venture to prescribe bounds", "space.

While the constructive talent seems dwarfed and superficial, the criticism is often in the noblest tone and suggests the presence of the invisible gods. I can well believe what I have often heard, that there are two nations in England; but it is not the Poor and the Rich, nor is it the Normans and Saxons, nor the Celt and the Goth\" These are each always becoming the other; for Robert OweJl does not exaggerate the power of circumstance.

CHAPTER XV THE TIMES THE power of the newspaper is familiar in America and in ac\"\"' cordance with our political system. In England, it stands in 662 ENGLISH TRAITS antagonism with the feudal institutions, and it is all the more beneficent succor against the secretive tendencies of a monarchy. The celebrated Lord Sonlers \"knew of no good law proposed and passed in his time, to which the public papers had not directed his attention.\" There is no corner an~ no night. A relentless inquisition drags every secret to the day, turns the glare of this solar microscope on every malfaisance, so as to make the public a more terrible spy than any foreigner; and no weakness can be taken advantage of by an enemy, since the whole people are already forewarned. Thus England rids herself of those jncrustations which have been the ruin of old states. Of course, this inspection is feared.

Thus England rids herself of those jncrustations which have been the ruin of old states. Of course, this inspection is feared. No antique privilege, no comfortable monopoly, but sees surely that its days are counted; the people are familiarized with the reason of reform, and, one by one, take away every argument of the obstructives. \"So your grace likes the comfort of reading the newspapers,\" said Lord Mans- field to the Duke of Northumberland; \"mark my words; you and I shall not live to see it, but this young gentleman (Lord Eldon) may, or it may be a little later; but a little sooner or later, these newspapers will most assuredly write the dukes of Northumberland out of their titles and possessions, and the country out of its king.\" The ten.dency in England towards social and political institutions like those of America, is inevitable, and the ability of its journals is the driving force. England is full of manly, clever, well-bred men Qrbo possess the talent of writing off-band pungent paragraphs, expressing with clearness and courage their opinion on any person or per ... formance. Valuable or not, it is a skill that is rarely found, out of the English journals. The English do this, as they write poetry, as they ride and box, by being educated to it. Hundreds of clever Praeds and Freres and Fraudes and Iioods and Hooks and l\\1a- ginns and l\\Iills and l\\1acaulays, make poems, or short essays for a journal, e.s they make speeches in Par liamen t and on the hustings, or as they shoot and ride.

It is a quite accidental and arbitrary direction of their general ability. Rude health and spir .. its, an Oxford education and the habits of society are implied, but not a ray of genius. It comes of the crowded state of the ENGLISH TRAITS professions, the violent interest which all men take in politics, the facility of experimenting in the journals, and high pay. The most conspicuous result of this talent is the 1\"\"imes ne';vs ... paper. No power in England is n10re felt, more feared, or more obeyed. What you read in the morning in that journal, you shall hear in the evening in all society. It has ears everywhere, and its information is earliest, completest and surest. It has risen1 year by year, and victory by victorY1 to its present authority. I asked one of its old contributors whether it had once beell abler than it is now? \"Never,\" he said; \"these are its palmiest days.\" It has shown those qualities which are dear to Englisb .. men, unflinching adherence to its objects, prodigal intellectual ability and a towering assurance, backed by the perfect organiza- tion in its printing-house and its world-wide network Ot corre ... spondence and reports. It has its 0wn history and famous trophies. In 1820, it adopted the cause of Queen Caroline, and carried it aga.inst the king. It adopted a poor-law system, and almost alone lifted it through.

Meantime, it attacks its rivaL:, by perfecting its printing machinery, and will drive them out of circulation: for the only limit to the circul~tion of The Tin1es is the in1possibility of printing copies fast enough; since a daily paper can only be new . and seasonable for a few hours. It will kill all but that paper which is diametrically in opposition; since many papers, first and last, have lived by their attacks on the leading journal. ENGLISH TRAITS The late Mr. Walter was printer of The Times, and had grad. ually arranged the whole materiel of it in perfect system. It is told that when he demanded a small share in the proprietary and was refused, he said, \"As you please, gentlemen; and you may take away The Times from this office when you will; I shall publish The New Times next Monday morning.\" The pro- prietors, who had already complained that his charges for print- mg were excessive, found that they were in his power,", "he said, \"As you please, gentlemen; and you may take away The Times from this office when you will; I shall publish The New Times next Monday morning.\" The pro- prietors, who had already complained that his charges for print- mg were excessive, found that they were in his power, and gave him whatever he wished. I went one day with a good friend to The Times office, which was entered through a pretty garden-yard in Printing-House Square. We walked with some circumspection, as if we were entering a powder-mill; but the door was opened by a mild old woman, and, by dint of some transmission of cards, we were at last conducted into the parlor of Mr. Morris, a very gentle person, with no hostile appearances. The statistics are now quite out of date, but I remember he told us that the daily printing was then 35,000 copies; that on the 1St March, 1848, the greatest number ever printed-54,000-were issued; that, since February, the daily circulation had increased by 8000 copies. The old press they were then using printed five or six thousand sheets per hour; the new machine, for which they were then building an engine, would print twelve thousand per hour. Our entertainer confided us to a courteous assistant to show us the establishment, in which, I think, they employed a hundred and twenty men. I remember I saw the reporters' room, in which they redact their hasty stenographs, but the editor's room, and who is in it, I did not see, though I shared the curi ... osity of mankind respecting it. The staff of The Times has always been made up of able men.

Old vValter, Sterling, Bacon, Barnes, Alsiger, Horace Twiss, Jones Lloyd, John Oxenford, Mr. Mosely, Mr. Bailey, have contributed to its renown in their special departInents. But it has never wanted the first pens for occasional assistance. Its private information is ine.\"{plicable, and recalls the stories of Fouche'.; police, whose omniscience made it believed that the Empress Josephine must be in his pay_ It has mercantile and ENGLISH TRAITS political correspondents in every foreign city, and its expresses outrun the despatches of the government. One hears anecdotes of the rise of its servants, as of the functionaries of the India House. I was told of the dexterity of one of its reporters, who, finding himself, on one occasion, where the magistrates had strictly forbidden reporters, put his hands into his coat-packetr and with pencil in one hand and tablet in the other, did his work. The influence of this journal is a recognized power in Europe, and, of course, none is nlore conscious of it than its conductors. The tone of its articles has often been the occasion of comment from the official organs of the continental courts, and sometimes the ground of diplomatic complaint. 'What would The Times say?' is a terror in Paris, in Berlin, in Vienna, in Copenhagen and in Nepaul. Its consummate discretion and success exhibit the English skill of combination. The daily paper is the work of many hands, chiefly, it is said, of young men recently frorr.t the University, and perhaps reading law in chambers in London. Hence the academic elegance and classic allusion which adorns its columns. Hence, too, the heat and gallantry of its", "skill of combination. The daily paper is the work of many hands, chiefly, it is said, of young men recently frorr.t the University, and perhaps reading law in chambers in London. Hence the academic elegance and classic allusion which adorns its columns. Hence, too, the heat and gallantry of its onset. But the steadiness of the aim suggests the belief that this fire is directed and fed by older engineers; as if persons of exact in- fonnation, and with settled views of policy, supplied the writer~ with the basis of fact and the object to be attained, and availed themselves of their younger energy and eloquence to plead the cause. Both the council and the executive departments gain by this division. Of two men of equal ability, the one who does not write but keeps his eye on the course of public affairs, will have the higher judicial wisdom. B'ut the parts are kept in concert, all the articles appear to proceed from a single will. The Times never disapproves of what itself has said, or cripples itself by apology for the absence of the editor, or the indiscretion of him who held the pen. It speaks out bluff and bold, and sticks to what it says. It draws from any number of learned and skilful contribu- tors; but a lnore learned and skilful person supervises, corrects, and co-ordinates. Of this closet, the secret does not transpire. No writer is suffered to claim the authorship of any paper; every- thing good, from whatever quarter, comes out editorially; and 666 ENGLISH TRAITS thus, by making the paper everything and those who write it nothing, the character and the awe of the journal gain.

The English like it for its complete information. A state- ment of fact in The Times is as reliable as a citation from Han- sard. Then they like its independence; they do not know, ,vhen they take it up, what their paper is going to say: but, above all, for the nationality and confidence of its tone. It thinks for them all; it is their understanding and day's ideal daguerreo- typed. \\Vhen I see them reading its columns, they seem to m~ becoming every moment more British. It has the national cour- age, not rash and petulant, but considerate and determined. No dignity or wealth is a shield from its assault. It attacks a duke as readily as a policeman, and with the most provoking airs of condescension. It makes rude work with the Board of Admiralty. The Bench of Bishops is still less safe. One bishop fares badly for his rapacity, and another for his bigotry, and a third for his courtliness. It addresses occasionally a hint to J\\ofajesty itself, and sometimes a hint which is taken. There is an air of freedom even in their advertising columns, which speaks well for England to a foreigner. On the days when I arrived in London in 1847, I read, among the daily announcements, one offering a re\\vard of fifty pounds to any person who would put a nobleman, de- scribed by name and title, late a n1ember of Parliament, into any county jail in England, he having been convicted of obtain- ing money under false pretences. \\Vas never such arrogancy as the tone of this paper.

But this arro- gance is calculated. \\Vho would care for it, if it \"surmised,\" or \"dared to cOllfess,\" or \"ventured to predict,\" etc.? No; it is so J and so it shall be. The morality and patriotism of The Times claim only to be representative, and by no means ideal. It gives the argument, not of the majority, but of the commanding class. Its editor\u00a3 know better than to defenr! Russia, or Austria, or English vested ENGLISH TRAITS 66'1 rights, on aLstract grounds. But they give a voice to the class. who at the mOlnent take the lead; and they have an instinct for finding where the power now lies, which is eternally shifting its banks. Sympathizing with, and speaking for the class that rules the hour, yet being apprised of every ground-swell, every Chartist resolution, every Church squabble, every strike in the mills, they detect the first tremblings of change. They watch the hard and bitter struggles of the authors of each liberal move-- ment, year by year; watching them only to taunt. and obstruct them-until, at last, when they see that these have established their fact, that power is on the point of passing to them, they strike in with the voice of a monarch, astonish", "of the authors of each liberal move-- ment, year by year; watching them only to taunt. and obstruct them-until, at last, when they see that these have established their fact, that power is on the point of passing to them, they strike in with the voice of a monarch, astonish those whom they succor as much as those whom they desert, and make victory sure. Of course the aspirants see that The Times is une of the goods of fortune, not to be won but by winning their cause. Punch is equally an expression of English good sense, as the London Times. It is the comic version of the same sense. Many of its caricatures are equal to the best pamphlets, and will convey to the eye in an instant the popular view which was taken of each turn of public affairs. Its sketches are usually made by masterly hands, and sometimes with genius; the delight of every class, because uniformly guided by that taste which is tyrannical in England. It is a new trait of the nineteenth cen .. tury, that the wit and humor of England-as in Punch, so in the humorists, Jerrold, Dickens, Thackeray, Hood-have taken the direction of humanity and freedom. The Times, like every important institution, shows the way to a better. It is a living index of the colossal British power, Its existence honors the people \\vho dare to print all they know,. dare to know all the facts and do not wish to be flattered by hiding the extent of the public disaster.

If only it dared , to cleave to the right, to show the right to be the only expedient, and feed its batteries from the central heart of humanity, it might not have so many men of rank among its contributors, but genius would be its cordial and invincible ally; it might now and then bear the brunt of formidable combinations, but no journal is ruined by wise courage. It would be the natural leader of British reform; its proud function, that of being the voice of Europe, the defender of the exile and patriot against despots, would be more effectually discharged; it would have the authority which is claimed for that dream of good men not yet come to pass, an International Congress; and the least of ~ its victories would be to give to England a new millennium of beneficent power. CHAPTER XVI STONEHENGE IT HAD been agreed between my friend Mr. Carlyle and me, that before I left England we should make an excursion together to Stonehenge, which neither of us had seen; and the project pleased my fancy with the double attraction of the monument and the companion. It", "CHAPTER XVI STONEHENGE IT HAD been agreed between my friend Mr. Carlyle and me, that before I left England we should make an excursion together to Stonehenge, which neither of us had seen; and the project pleased my fancy with the double attraction of the monument and the companion. It seemed a bringing together of extreme points, to visit the oldest religious monument in Britain in com .. pany with her latest thinker, and one whose influence may be traced in every contemporary book. I was glad to sum up a little my experiences, and to exchange a few reasonable words on the aspects of England with a man on whose genius I set a very high value, and who had as much penetration and as severe a theory of duty as any person in it. On Friday, 7th July, we took the South Western Railway through Hampshire to Salisbury, where we found a carriage to convey us to Amesbury. The fine weather and my friend's local knowledge of Hampshire, in which he is wont to spend a part of every summer, made the way short. There was much to say, too, of the travelling Ameri .. ENGLISH TRAITS cans and their usual objects in London. I thought it natural that they should give some time to works of art collected here which they cannot find at home, and a little to scientific clubs and museums, which, at this moment, make London very at ... tractive. But Iny philosopher was not contented. Art and 'high art' is a favorite target for his wit. \"Yes, Kunst is a great de- lusion, and Goethe and Schiller wasted a great deal of good time on it: \"-and he thinks he discovers that old Goethe found this out, and, in his later writings, changed", "not contented.

As soon as men begin to talk of art, architecture and antiquities, nothing good comes of it. He wishes to go through the British Museum in silence, and thinks a sincere man will see something and say nothing. In these days, he thought, it would become an architect to consult only the grim necessity, and say, 'I can build you a coffin for such dead persons as you are, and for such dead pur- poses as you have, but you shall have no ornament.' For the science, he had if possible even less tolerance, and compared the savants of Somerset House to the boy who asked Confucius \"how many stars in the sky?\" Confucius replied, \"he minded things near him:\" then said the boy, ('how many hairs are there in your eyebrows?\" Confucius said, \"he didn't know and didn't care.\" Still speaking of the Americans, Carlyle complained that they dislike the coldness and exclusiveness of the English, and run away to France and go with their countrymen and are amused, instead of manfully staying in London, and confronting Eng- lishmen and acquiring their culture, who really have much to teach them. I told Carlyle that I was easily dazzled, and was accustomed to concede readily all that an Englishman would ask; I saw everywhere in the country proofs of sense and spirit, and suc- cess of every sort: I like the people; they are as good as they are handsome; they ha ve everything and can do everything;", "dazzled, and was accustomed to concede readily all that an Englishman would ask; I saw everywhere in the country proofs of sense and spirit, and suc- cess of every sort: I like the people; they are as good as they are handsome; they ha ve everything and can do everything; but meantime, I surely know that as soon as I return to Massa- chusetts I shall lapse at once into the feeling, which the geog- raphy of America inevitably inspires, that we play the game with immense advantage; that there and not here is the seat and ENGLISH TRAITS centre of the British race; and that no skill or activity can long conlpete with the prodigious natural advantages of that country, in the hands of the same race; and that England, an old and exhausted island, must one day be contented, like other parents, to be strong only in her children. But this vias a proposition whh:h no Englishman of whatever condition can easily entertain. \\Ve left the train at Salisbury and took a carriage to ,Ames- bury, passing by Old Sarurn, a bare, treeless hill, once containing the town which sent two members to Parliament-now, not a hut; and, arriving at Amesbury, stopped at the George Inn. After dinner we walked to Salisbury Plain. On the broad downs, under the gray sky, not a house was visible, nothing but Stone- henge, which looked like a group of brown dwarfs in the wide expanse-Stonehenge and the barro,Ys, which rose like green bosses about the plain. and a few hayricks. On the top of a moun .. tain, the old temple would not be more impressive. Far and wide a few shepherds with their flocks sprinkled the plain, and a bagman drove along the road.

It looked as if the wide margin given in this crowded isle to this primeval temple ,\\\\\"ere ac .. corded by the veneration of the British race to the old egg out of which all their ecclesiastical structures and history had pro- ceeded. Stonehenge is a circular colonnade with a diameter of a hundred feet, and enclosing a second and a third colonnade within. \\\\1 e walked round the stones and clambered over them, to wont ourselves with their strange aspect and groupings, and found a nook sheltered from the wind among them, where Car .. lyle lighted his cigar. It was pleasant to see that just this simplest of all simple structures-two upright stones and a lintel laid across-had long outstood all later churches and all history, and were like what is most permru\"lent on the face of the planet: these, and the barrows-mere mounds (of which there are a hundred and si~ty within a circle of three miles about Stone- henge), like the same mound on the plain of Troy, which still makes good to the passing mariner on Hellespont, the vaunt of Honler and the fame of Achilles. Within the enclosure grow but~ercups, nettles, and all around, wild thyme, daisy, meadow- sweet, goldenrod, thistle and the carpeting grass.

There are ninety-four stones, and there were once probably one hundred and sixty. The temple is circular and uncovered, and the situation fixed astr-onomically -the grand entrances, here and at Abury, being placed exactly northeast, \"as all the gates of the old cavern temples are.\" How came the stones here? for these sarsens, or Druidical sandstones, are not found in this neighborhood. The sacrificial stone, as it is called, is the only one in all these blocks that can resist the action of fire, and as I read in the books, nlust have been brought one hundred and fifty miles. On alnl0st every stone we found the nlarks of the Inineralo- gist's hamlner and chisel. rfhe nineteen smaller stones of the inner circle are of granite. I, who had just conle fro111 Professor Sedgwick's Cambride M useurn of nlcgatheria and 111astodons, was ready to maintain that SOlne cleverer elephants or 111ylodonta had borne off and laid these rocks one on another. Only the good beasts must have known how to cut a well-wrought tenon and mortise, a.nd to smooth the surface of son1e of the stones.

In this quiet house of destiny he happens to say, \"I plant cypresses wherever I go, and if I am in search of pain, I cannot go wrong.\" The spot, the gray blocks and their rude order, which refuses t'O be disposed of, suggested to him the flight of ages and the suc- cession of religions. The old times of England impress Carlyle much: he reads little, he says, in these last years, but Acta Sanctorum ,\" the fifty-three volumes of which are in the London Library. He finds all English history therein. He can see, as he reads, the old Saint of lana sitting there and writing, a man to men ..

The Acta Sanctorum show plainly that the men of those times believed in God and in the immortality of the soul, as their abbeys and cathedrals testify: now, even the puritanism is all gone. London is pagan. He fancied that greater nlen had lived in England than any of her writers; and, in fact, about the time when those ~Triters appeared, the last of these were already gone. We left the mound in the twilight, with the design to return the next morning, and coming back two miles to our inn we were met by little showers, and late as it was, men and women were out attempting to protect their spread windows. The grass grows rank and dark in the showery England. At the inn, there was only milk for one cup of tea. 'Vhen we called for more, the girl brought us three drops. lVly friend was annoyed, who stood for the credit of an English inn, and still more the next morning, by the dog-cart, sole procurable vehicle, in which we were to be sent to 'Vilton. I engaged the local antiquary, Mr. Brown, to go with us to Stonehenge, on our way, and show us what he knew of the \"astronomical\" and \"sacrificial\" stones. I stood on the last, and he pointed to the upright, or rather, inclined stone, called the \"astronomical,\" and bade me notice that its top ranged with the sky-line. \"y\"'es.\" Very well.

Now, at the summer solstice, the sun rises exactly over the top of that stone, and, at the Druidical temple at Abury, there is also an astronomical stone, in the same relative position. In the silence of tradition, this one relation to science becomes t GLISH TRAITS an important clew; but we were content to leave the problem with the rocks. Was this the \"Giants' Dance,\" which Merlin brought from Killaraus, in Ireland, to be Uther Pendragon's monument to the British nobles whom Hengist slaughtered here, as Geoffrey of Monmouth relates? or was it a Roman work, as Inigo Jones explained to King James; or identical in design and style with the East Indian temples of the sun, as Davies in the Celtic Researches Fnaintains? Of all the writers, Stukeley is the best. The heroic antiquary, charmed with the geometric perfec-- tions of his ruin, connects it with the oldest monuments and religion of the world, and \"vith the courage of his tribe, does not stick to say, \"the Deity who made the world by the schelne of Stonehenge.\" He finds that the curs'Us on Salisbury Plain stretches across the downs like a line of latitude upon the globe, and the meridian line of Stonehenge passes exactly through the middle of this cursus. But here is the high point of the theory: ~he Druids had the magnet; laid their courses by it; their cardi ... nal points in Stonehenge, Ambresbury, and elsewhere, which vary a little from true east and west, followed the variations of the compass.

The Druids were Phrenicians. The name of the magnet is lapis Heracleus, and Hercules was the god of the Phrenicians. Hercules, in the legend, drew his bow at the sun, and the sun-god gave him a golden cup, with which he sailed over the ocean. What was this, but a compass-box? This cup or little boat, in which the magnet was made to float on water and so show the north, was probably its first form, before it was suspended on a pin. But science was an arCan'lt1n, and; as Britain was a Phrenician secret, so they kept their compass a secret, and it was lost with the Tyrian commerce. The golden fleece again, of Jason, was the compass-a bit of loadstone, easily supposed to be the only one in the world, and therefore naturally awakening the cupidity and ambition of the young heroes of a maritime nation to join in an expedition to obtain possessio!\" ',f this wise stone. Hence the fable that the ship Argo was loquacious and oracular. There is also some curious coincidence in the names. Apollodorus n1akes Magnes the son of Aeolus, who mar ... ried N ais.

I chanced to see, a year ago, men at work on the substructure of a house in Bowdoin Square, in Boston, swinging a block of granite of the size of the largest of the Stonehenge columns~ with an ordinary derrick. The men ,\\,\\rere comillon ma- sons, with paddies to help, nor dio they think they were doing anything remarkable. I suppose there were as good nlen a thou- sand years ago. And we ,vander how Stonehenge VtTas built and forgotten. After spending half an bour on the spot, we set forth in our dog-cart over the downs for \"\"Tilton, Carlyle not suppress- ing some threats and evil omens on the proprietors, for keep- ing these broad plains a wretched sheep-walk when so Inany thousands of English men were hungry and wanted labor. But I heard afterwards that it is not an economy to cultivate this la.nd, which only yields one croiJ on being broken up, and is then spoiled. We came to Wilton and to Vlilton Hall-the renowned seat of the Earls of Pembroke, a house kno,\\\\Tfl to Shakspeare and ]\\tlassinger, the frequent home of Sir Philip Sidney, where he wrote the Arcadia; where he conversed with Lord Brooke, a man of deep thought, and a poet, who caused to be engraved on his tombstone, \"Here lies Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, the friend of Sir Philip Sidney.\" It is now the property of the Earl of Pembroke, and the residence of his brother, Sidney Herbert, Esq., and", "Lord Brooke, a man of deep thought, and a poet, who caused to be engraved on his tombstone, \"Here lies Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, the friend of Sir Philip Sidney.\" It is now the property of the Earl of Pembroke, and the residence of his brother, Sidney Herbert, Esq., and is esteemed a noble specinlen of the English manor- hall. ~'ly friend had a letter from Mr. Herbert to his house- keeper, and the house was shown. The state drawing-room is a. double cube, 30 feet high, by 30 feet wide, by 60 feet long: the adjoining room is a single cube, of 30 feet every \"ray. Although \\hese apartments and the long library ~Tere full of good family portraits, v\"'andykes and other; and though there were some good pictures, and a quadrangle cloister full of antique and modern statuary-to which Carlyle, catalogue in hand, did all ENGLISH TRAITS too much justice-yet the eye was still drawn to the windows, to a magnificent lawn, on which grew the finest cedars in Eng .. land. I had not seen more charming grounds. We went out, and walked over the estate. We crossed a bridge built by Inigo Jones, over a stream of which the gardener did not know the name (Qu. Alph?); watched the deer; climbed to the lonely sculptured slunmer-house, on a hill backed by a wood; came down into the Italian garden and into a French pavilion gar- nished with French busts; and so again to the house, where we found a table laid for us with bread, meats, peaches, grapes and wine. On leaving vVilton House, we took. the coach for Salisbury. The Cathedral, which was finished six hundred years ago, has even a spruce and modern air, and its spire is the highest in England.

The Cathedral, which was finished six hundred years ago, has even a spruce and modern air, and its spire is the highest in England. I know not why, but I had been more struck with one of no fame, at Coventry, which rises three hundred feet from the ground, with the lightness of a mullein plant, and not at all implicated with the church. Salisbury is now esteemed the culmination of the Gothic art in England, as the buttresses are fully unmasked and honestly detailed frOIn the sides of the pile. The interior of the Cathedral is obstructed by the organ in the Iniddle, acting like a screen. I know not why in real architecture the hunger of the eye for length of line is so rarely gratified. The rule of art is that a colonnade is more beautiful the longer it is, and that ad infinitum. And the nave of a church is seldonl so long that it need be divided by a screen. We loitered in the church, outside the choir, whilst service was said. Whilst we listened to the organ, my friend renlarked, the music is good, and yet not quite religious, but somewhat as if a monk were panting to some fine Queen of Heaven. Carlyle was unwiJling, and we did not ask to have the choir shown us, but returned to our inn, after seeing another old church of the place. We passed in the train Clarendon Park., but could see little but the edge of a wood, though Carlyle had wished to pay closer attention to the birthpl.ace of the Decrees of Clarendon.

At Bishopstoke we stopped, and found Mr. H., who received un in his carriage, and took us to his house at Bishops Waltham. ENGLrSH TRAITS On Sunday we had much discourse, on a very rainy day .. My frjends asked, whether there were any Americans?-any with an American idea-any theory of the right future of that :ountry? Thus challenged, I bethought myself neither of cau- cuses nor congress, neither of presidents nor of cabinet-min- isters, nor of such as would make of America another Europe. I thought only of the simplest and purest minds; I said, \"Cer- tainly yes-but those who hold it are fanatics of a dream which I should hardly care to relate to your English ears, to which it might be only ridiculous-and yet it is the only true.\" So I opened the dogma of no-government and non-resistance, and anticipated the objections and the fun, and procured a kind of hearing for it. I said, it is true that I have never seen in any country a man of sufficient valor to stand for this truth, and yet it is plain to me that no less valor than this can command my respect. I can easily see the bankruptcy of the vulgar musket- worship-though great men be musket-worshippers-and 't is certain as God liveth, the gun that does not need another gun, the law of love and justice alone, can effect a clean revolution I fancied that one or two of my anecdotes made some impres- sion on Carlyle, and I insisted that the", "great men be musket-worshippers-and 't is certain as God liveth, the gun that does not need another gun, the law of love and justice alone, can effect a clean revolution I fancied that one or two of my anecdotes made some impres- sion on Carlyle, and I insisted that the manifest absurdity of the view to English feasibility could make no difference to a gentle- man; that as to our secure tenure of our mutton-chop and spin- ach in London or in Boston, the soul might quote Talleyrand, \"Monsieur, je n'en vois pas la necessite.\" As I had thus taken in the conversation the saint's part, when dinner was announced, Carlyle refused to go out before me-\"he was altogether too wicked.\" I planted my back against the wall, and our host wittily rescued us from the dilemma, by saying he was the wickedest and would walk out first, then Carlyle followed, and I went last. On the way to \\Vinchester, whither our host accompanied us in the afternoon, my friends asked many questions respecting American landscapes, forests, houses-my house, for example. It is not easy to answer these queries well. There, I thought, in America. lies nature sleeping, overgrowing, almost conscious, too much by half for man in the picture, and so giving a certain tristesse, like the rank. vegetation of swamps and forests seen ENGLISH TRAITS at night, steeped in dews and rains, which it loves; and on it man seems not able to make much impression. There, in that great sloven continent, in high Alleghany pastures, in the sea- w{de sky-skirted prairie, still sleeps and murmurs and hides the great mother, long since driven away from the trim hedge-rows and over-cultivated garden of England. And, in England, I am quite too sensible of this. Everyone is on his", "that great sloven continent, in high Alleghany pastures, in the sea- w{de sky-skirted prairie, still sleeps and murmurs and hides the great mother, long since driven away from the trim hedge-rows and over-cultivated garden of England. And, in England, I am quite too sensible of this. Everyone is on his good behavior and must be dressed for dinner at six. So I put off my friends with very inadequate details, as best I could. Just before entering Winchester we stopped at the Church of Saint Cross, and after looking through the quaint antiquity, we demanded a piece of bread and a draught of beer, which the founder, Henry de Blois, in I I36, commanded should be given to everyone who should ask it at the gate. We had both, from the old couple who take care of the church. Some twenty people every day, they said, make the same demand. This hospitality of seven hundred years' standing did not hinder Carlyle from pro- nouncing a malediction on the priest who receives \u00a32000 a year, that were meant for the poor, and spends a pittance on this small-beer and crumbs. In the Cathedral I was gratified, at least by the ample dimen- sions. The length of line exceeds that of any other English church; being 556 feet, by 250 in breadth of transept. I think I prefer this church to all I have seen, except Westminster and York. Here was Canute buried, and here Alfred the Great was crowned and buried, and here the Saxon kings;' and, later, in his own church, William of Wykeham. It is very old: part of the crypt into which we went down and saw the Saxon and Norman arches of the old church on which the present stands, was built fourteen or fifteen hundred years", "and here the Saxon kings;' and, later, in his own church, William of Wykeham. It is very old: part of the crypt into which we went down and saw the Saxon and Norman arches of the old church on which the present stands, was built fourteen or fifteen hundred years ago. Sharon Turner, in his History of the Anglo-Saxons, says, \"Alfred was buried at Winchester, in the Abbey he had founded there, but his remains were removed by Henry I to the new Abbey in the meadows at Hyde, on the northern quarter of the city, and laid under the high altar. The building was destroyed at the Reforma- tion, and what is left of Alfred's body now lies covered by modern buildings, or buried in the ruins of the ald.\" William of ENGLISH TRAITS \"Tykeham's shrine tomb was unlocked for us, and Carlyle took hold of the recumbent statue's marble hands and patted them affectionately, for he rightly values the brave man who built Windsor and this Cathedral and the School here and New College at Oxford. But it was growing late in the afternoon. Slowly we left the old house, and parting with our host, we took the train for London. (:HAPTER XVII PERSONAL IN THESE comments on an old journey, now revised after seven busy years have much changed men and things in England, I have abstained from reference to persons, except in the last chapter and in one or two cases where the fame of the parties seemed to have given the public a property in all that concerned them. I must further allow myself a few notices, if only as an ackno\\vledgment of debts that cannot be paid.

I must further allow myself a few notices, if only as an ackno\\vledgment of debts that cannot be paid. My journeys were cheered by so much kindness from new friends, that my impression of the island is bright with agreeable memories both of public societies and of households: and, what is nowhere bet- ter found than in England, a cultivated person fitly surrounded by a happy home, with \"Honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\" is of all institutions the best. At the landing in Liverpool I found my Manchester correspondent awaiting me, a gentleman whose kind reception was followed by a train of friendly and effective attentions which never rested whilst I remained in the country. A man of sense and of letters, the editor of a powerful local journal, he added to solid virtues an infinite s'\\\\\"eetness and honhorllmie4 There seemed a pool of honey about his heart which lubricated all his speech and action with fine jets of mead. An equal good fortune attended many later accidents of nlY journey, until the sincerity of English kindness ceased to surprise. My visit fell in the fortunate days when Mr. Bancroft was the ENGLISH TRAITS American Minister in London, and at his house, or through his good offices, I had easy access to excellent persons and to privj\u00b7 leged places. At the house of Mr. Carlyle, I met persons e111inent in society and in letters. The privileges of the Athenreum and of the Reform Clubs were hospitably opened to nle, and I found much advantage in the circles of the 'L Geologic,\" the (' .l\\ntiquar .. ian\" and the \"Royal\" Societies.

It was Iny privilege also to converse with Miss Baillie, with Lady l\\iorgan, with Mrs. Jameson and Mrs. Som- erville. A finer hospitality made many private houses not les~ known and dear. It is not in distinguished circles that wisdom and elevated characters are usually found, or, if found, they are not confined thereto; and my recollections of the best hours go back to private conversations in different parts of the king ... dom, with persons little known. Nor am I insensible to the courtesy which frankly opened to me some noble mansions, if I do not adorn my page with their names. Anlong the privileges of London, I recall with pleasure t~\u00b7o or three signal days, on\u20ac' at Kew, where Sir Willialn Hooker showed me all the riches of the vast botanic garden; one at the l\\luseum, where Sir Charles Fellowes explained in detail the history of his Ionic trophy-monument; and still another, on which Mr. Owen accom ... panied my countryman Mr. H. and myself through the Hun~ terian 1tl useum.

At Edinburgh, through the kindness of Dr. SalTIuel Brown, I made the acquaintance of De Quincey, of Lord Jeffrey, of Wilson, of Mrs. Crowe, of the l\\iessrs.

At Ambleside in March, I848, J was for a couple ot days the guest of Miss Martineau, then newly returned from her Egyptian tour. On Sunday afternoon I accompanied her to Rydal 11ount. And as I have recorded a visit to Wordsworth, many years before, I must not forget this second interview. We found Mr. \\'Vordsworth asleep on the sofa. He was at first silent and indisposed, as an old man suddenly 1Naked before he had ended his nap; but soon became full of talk on the French news. He was nationally bitter on the French; bitter on Scotchmen, too. No Scotchman, he said, can write English. He detailed the two models, on one or the other of which all the sentences of the historian Robertson are framed. Nor could Jeffrey, nor the Edinburgh Reviewers write English, nor can * * *, who is a pest to the English tongue. Incidentally he added, Gibbon cannot write English. The Edinburgh Review wrote what would tell and what would sell. It had however changed the tone of its literary criticism from the time when a certain letter was written to the ~ditor by Coleridge. Mrs. \\V.", "a pest to the English tongue. Incidentally he added, Gibbon cannot write English. The Edinburgh Review wrote what would tell and what would sell. It had however changed the tone of its literary criticism from the time when a certain letter was written to the ~ditor by Coleridge. Mrs. \\V. had the Editor's answer in her possession. Tennyson he thinks a right poetic genius, though with some affectation. He had thought an elder brother of Tennyson at first the better poet, but must now reckon Alfred the true one. . . . In speaking of I know not what style, he said, \"to be sure, it was the manner, but then you know the matter always comes out of the manner.\" ... He thought Rio Janeiro the best place in the world lor a great capital city .... We talked of English national character. I told him it was not creditable that no one in all the country knew anything of Thomas Taylor, the Platonist, whilst in every American library his translations are found. I said, If Plato's Republic were pub .. lished in England as a new book to-day, do you think it would find any readers?-he confessed it would not: \"And yet,\" he added after a pause, with that complacency which never deserts a true-born Englishman, \"and yet we have embodied it all.\" His opinions of French, English, Irish and Scotch, seemed rashly formulized from little anecdotes of what had befallen ENGLISH TRAITS 68J himself and members of his family, in a diligence or stage .. coach. His face sometimes lighted up, but his conversation was not marked by special force or elevation. Yet perhaps it is a high compliment to the cultivation of the English generally, when we find such a man not distinguished. He had a", "his family, in a diligence or stage .. coach. His face sometimes lighted up, but his conversation was not marked by special force or elevation. Yet perhaps it is a high compliment to the cultivation of the English generally, when we find such a man not distinguished. He had a healthy look, with a \"\\veather-beaten face, his face corrugated, espe- cially the large nose. Miss Martineau, who lived near him, praised him to me not for his poetry, but for thrift and economy; for having afforded to his country-neighbors an example of a modest household where comfort and culture were secured without any display. She said that in his early housekeeping at the cottage where he first lived, he was accustomed to offer his friends bread and plainest fare; if they wanted anything nlore, they must pay him for their board. It was the rule of the house. I replied that it evinced English pluck more than any anecdote I knew. A gen- tleman in the neighborhood told the story of Walter Scott's staying once for a week with Wordsworth, and slipping out every day, under pretence of a walk, to the Swan Inn for a cold cut and porter; and one day passing with Wordsworth the inn, he was betrayed by the landlord's asking him if he had come far his porter. Of course this trait would have another look in London, and there you will hear from different literary men that Wordsworth had no personal friend, that he was not amiable, that he was parsimonious, etc. Landor, always generolls, says that he never praised anybody. A gentleman in London showed me a watch that once belonged to Milton, whose initials are engraved on its face. He said he once showed this to Wordsworth, who took it in one", "was not amiable, that he was parsimonious, etc. Landor, always generolls, says that he never praised anybody. A gentleman in London showed me a watch that once belonged to Milton, whose initials are engraved on its face. He said he once showed this to Wordsworth, who took it in one hand, then drew out his own watch and held it up with the other, before the company, but no one making the expected remark, he put back his own in silence. I do not attach much importance to the disparagement of Wordsworth among London scholars. Who reads him well will know that in iollowing the strong bent of his genius, he was careless of the many, careless also of the few, self-assured that he should \"create the taste by which he is to be enjoyed.\" He lived long enough to witness the revolution he had wrought, and to \"see what he 682 ENGLISH TRAITS foresaw.\" Thele are torpid places in his mind, there is son1e- thing hard and sterile in his poetry, want of grace and variety~ want of due catholicity and cosmopolitan scope: he had con- formities to English politics and traditions; he had egotistic puerilities in the choice and treatment of his subjects; but let us say of him that, alone in his time, he treated the human mind well, and with an absolute trust. His adherence to his poetic creed rested on real inspirations. The Ode on Immortality is the high-\\vater mark which the intellect has reached in this age. New means were employed, and n.ew realms added to the em- pire of the muse, by his courage. CHAPTER XVIII RESULT ENGLAND is the best of actual nations.

New means were employed, and n.ew realms added to the em- pire of the muse, by his courage. CHAPTER XVIII RESULT ENGLAND is the best of actual nations. It is no ideal framework, it is an old pile built in different ages, with repairs, additions and makeshifts; but you see the poor best you have got. London is the epitome of our times, and the Rome of to-day. Broarl- fronted, broad-bottomed Teutons, they stand in solid phalanx foursquare to the points of compass; they constitute the modern world, they have earned their vantage ground and held it through ages of adverse possession. They are well marked and differing irom other leading races. England is tender-hearted. Ron1e was not. England is not so public in its bias; private life is its place of honor. Truth in private life, untruth in public, marks these home-loving men. Their political conduct is not decided by general views, but by internal intrigues and personal and family interest. They cannot readily see beyond England. The history of Rome and Greece, when written by their scholars, degen ... erates into English party pamphlets. They cannot see beyond England, nor in England can they transcend the interests of the governing classes. \"English principles\" mean a primary re- gard to the interests of property. England, Scotland and Ire- land combine to check the colonies. England and Scotland com- bine to check Irish manufactures and trade. England rallies ENGLISH TRAITS at home to check Scotland.

In the home population of near thirty millions, there are but one million voters. The Church punishes dissent, pun\", ishes education. Down to a late day, marriages performed by dissenters were illegal. A bitter class-legislation gives power to those who are rich enough to buy a law. The game-laws are a proverb of oppression. Pauperism incrusts and clogs the state, and in hard times becomes hideous.. In bad seasons, the porridge was diluted. Multitudes lived miserably by shell-fish and sea-ware. In cities, the children are trained to beg, until they shall be olu enough to rob. Men and women were convicted of poisoning scores of children for burial-fees. In Irish districts, men deteriorated in size and shape, the nose sunk, the gums were exposed, with diminished brain and brutal form. During the Australian emigration, multitudes were rejected by the com\u00b7\u00b7 missioners as being too emaciated for useful colonists. During the Russian war, few of those that offered as recruits were found up to the medical standard, though it had been reduced. The foreign policy of England, though ambitious and lavish of money, has not often been generous or just. It has a principal regard to the interest of trade, checked however by the aristo- cratic bias of the ambassador, \"vhich usually puts him in sym- pathy with the continental Courts. It sanctioned the partitioIJ of Poland, it betrayed Genoa, Sicily, Parma, Greece, Turkey, Rome and Hungary. Some public regards they have. They have abolished slavery in the West Indies and put an end to human sacrifices in the East. At home they have a certain statute hospitality.

At home they have a certain statute hospitality. England keeps open doors, as a trading country must, to all nations. It is one of their fixed ideas, and wrathfully supported by their iaws in unbroken sequence for a thousand years. In Magna Charta it was ordained that all \"merchants shall have safe and secure conduct to go out and come into England, and to stay there, and to pass as well by land as by water, to buy and sell by the ancient allowed customs, without any evil toll, except in time of war, or when they shall be of any nation at war with us.\" It is a statute and obliged hospitality and peremptorily ENGLISH'rRAITS maintained. But this shop-rule bad one magnificent effect. It extends its cold unalterable courtesy to political exiles of every opinion, and is a fact which might give additional light to that portion of the planet seen from the farthest star. But this per- functory hospitality puts no sweetness into their unaccommo .. dating manners, no check on that puissant nationality which makes their existence incompatible with all that is not English. What we must say about a nation is a superficial dealing with symptoms. We cannot go deep enough into the biography of the spirit who never throws himself entire into one hero, but delegates his energy in parts or spasms to vicious and defec:tive individuals. But the wealth of the source is seen in the plenitude of English nature ..

No one man and no few men can represent them. It is a people i)f myriad personalities. Their many-headedness is owing to the advantageous position of the middle class, who are always the source of letters and science. Hence the vast plenty of their resthetic production. As they are many-headed, so they are many-nationed: their colonization annexes archipelagoes and continents, and their speech seems destined to be the universal language of men. I have noted the reserve of power in the Eng .. lish temperament. In the island, they never let out all the length of all the reins, there is no Berserker rage, no abandon .. ment or ecstasy of will or intellect, like that of the Arabs in ~;he time of Mahomet, or like that which intoxicated France in 1789- But who would see the uncoiling of that tremendous spring, the explosion of their well-husbanded forces, must follow the swarms which pouring now for two hundred years from the British islands, have sailed and rode and traded and planted through all climates, mainly following the belt of empire, the temperate zones, carrying the Saxon seed, with its instinct for ENGLISH TRAITS 68~ liberty and law, for arts and for thought-acquiring under some skies a more electric energy than the native air allows-to the conquest of the globe.

Their colonial policy, obeying the neces .. sities of a vast empire, has become liberal. Canada and Australia have been contented with substantial independence. They are expiating the wrongs of India by benefits; first, in works for the irrigation of the peninsula, and roads, and telegraphs; and sec .. ondly, in the instruction of the people, to qualify them for self .. government, when the British power shall be finally called home. Their mind is in a state of arrested development-a divine cripple like Vulcan; a blind savant like Huber and Sanderson. They do not occupy themselves on matters of general and lasting import, but on a corporeal civilization, on goods that perish in the using. But they read with good intent, and what they learn they il1carnate. The English mind turns every abstraction it can reeeive into a portable utensil, or a working institution. Such is their tenacity and such their practical turn, that they hold all they gain. Hence we say that only the English race can be trusted with freedom-freedom which is double-edged and dangerous to any but the wise and robust. The English desig .. nate the kingdoms emulous of free institutions, as the senti- mental nations. Their culture is not an outside varnish, but is thorough and secular in families and the race. They are oppres- sive with their temperament, and all the more that they are refined. I have sometimes seen them walk with my countrymen when I was forced to allow them every advantage, and their companions seemed", "an outside varnish, but is thorough and secular in families and the race. They are oppres- sive with their temperament, and all the more that they are refined. I have sometimes seen them walk with my countrymen when I was forced to allow them every advantage, and their companions seemed bags of bones. There is cramp limitation in their habit of thought, sleepy routine, and a tortoise's instinct to hold hard to the ground with his claws, lest he should be thrown on his back. There is a drag of inertia which resists reform in every shape-law-reform, army-reform, extension of suffrage, Jewish franchise, Catholic emancipation-the abolition of slavery, of impressment, penal code and entails. They praise this drag, under the formula that it is the excellence of the British constitution that no law can anticipate the public opinion. These poor tortoises must hold 686 ENGLISH TRAITS hard, for they feel no wings sprouting at their shoulders. Yet somewhat divine warms at their heart and waits a happier hour. It hides in their sturdy will. \"Will,\" said the old philosophy, \"is the measure of power/' and personality ~:; LilE: token of this race. Quid vult valde vult. What they do t!iey do with a will. You cannot account for their success by their Christianity, com .. merce, charter, common law, Parliament, or letters, but by the I contumacious sharp-tongued energy of English naturel, with a poise impossible to disturb, which makes all these its instru- ments. They are slow and reticent, and are like a dull good horse which lets every nag pass him, but with whip and spur will run down every racer in the field. They are right in their feeling, though wrong in their speculation.

They are right in their feeling, though wrong in their speculation. The feudal system survives in the steep inequality of property and privilege, in the limited franchise, in the social barriers which confine patronage and promotion to a caste, and still more in the submissive ideas pervading these people. The fag- ging of the schools is repeated in the social classes. An English- man shows no mercy to those below him in the social scale, as he looks for none from those above him; any forbearance from his superiors surprises him, and they suffer in his good opinion. But the feudal system can be seen with less pain on large his- torical grounds. It was pleaded in mitigation of the rotten bor- ough, that it worked well, that substantial justice was done. Fox, Burke, Pitt, Erskine, Wilberforce, Sheridan, Romilly, or what- ever national man, were by this means sent to Parliament, when their return by large constituencies would have been doubtful. So now we say that the right measures of England are the men it bred; that it has yielded more able men in five hundred years than any other nation; and, though we must not play Providence and balance the chances of producing ten great men against the comfort of ten thousand mean men, yet retrospectively, we may ( strike the balance and prefer one Alfred, one Shakspeare, one J\\.iilton, one Sidney, one Raleigh, one Wellington, to a million foolish democrats.

Con\u00b7 gress is not wiser or better than Parliament. France has abot ished its suffocating old regi11te, but is not recently nlarked b}\" any more wisdom or virtue. The power of performance has not been exceeded-the cre~ ation of value. The English have given importance to individuals, a principal enel and fruit of every society. Every man is allowed and encouraged to be what he is, and is guarded in the indulgence of his whim. \"l\\iagna Charta,\" said Rushworth, \"is such a fellow that he will have no sovereign.\" By this general activity and by this sacredness of individuals, they have in seven hundred years evolved the principles of freedom. It is the land of patriots: martyrs, sages and bards, and if the ocean out of which it emerged should wash it away, it will be remembered as an island famouS\" for immortal laws, for the announcements of original right which' make the stone tables of liberty. CHAPTER XIX SPEECH AT l\\{ANCHESTER A FEW days after my arrival at l\\fanchester, in Novembet, I847, the Manchester Athenreum gave its annual Banquet in the Free-Trade Hall. vVith other guests, I was invited to be present and to address the cOlnpany. In looking over recently a newspaper-report of my remarks, I incline to reprint it, as fitly expressing the feeling with which I entered England, and which agrees well enough with the more deliberate results of better acquaintance recorded in the foregoing pages. Sir Archibald Alison, the historian, presided, and opened the meeting", "over recently a newspaper-report of my remarks, I incline to reprint it, as fitly expressing the feeling with which I entered England, and which agrees well enough with the more deliberate results of better acquaintance recorded in the foregoing pages. Sir Archibald Alison, the historian, presided, and opened the meeting with a speech. He was followed by Mr. Cobden, Lord Brackley and others, among ,vhom was ~lr. Cruikshank, one of the contribu- tors to Punch. l\\ir. Dickens's letter of apology for his:; absence was read. l\\1r. Jerrold, who had been announced.. did not appear. On being introduced to the Dleeting I said- Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: It is pleasant to TIle to Meet this great and brilliant company, and doubly pleasant to see the 688 ENGLISH TRAITS faces of so many distinguished persons on this platform. But I have known all these persons already. When I was at home, they were as near to me as they are to you. The arguments of the League and its leader are known to all the iriends of free trade. The gayeties and genius, the political, the social, the flarietal wit of Punch go duly every fortnight to every boy and girl in Boston and New York. Sir, when I came to sea, I found the History of Europe, by Sir A. Alison, on the ship's cabin table, the property of the captain-a sort of programme or play-bill to tell the seafaring New Englander what he shall find on his landing here. And as for Dombey, sir, there is no land where paper exists to print on, where it is not found; no man who can read, that does not read it, and, if he cannot, he finds some char- itable pair of eyes that can, and hears it .. But these things", "as for Dombey, sir, there is no land where paper exists to print on, where it is not found; no man who can read, that does not read it, and, if he cannot, he finds some char- itable pair of eyes that can, and hears it .. But these things are not for me to say; these compliments, though true, would better come from one who felt and under- stood these merits more .. I am not here to exchange civilities with you, but rather to speak of that which I am sure interests these gentlemen more than their ovvn praises; of that which is good in holidays and '''lorking-days, the same in one century and in another century. That vvhich lures a solitary American in the woods with the wish to see England, is the moral peculiarity of the Saxon race-its commanding sense of right and wrong, the love and devotion to that-ihis is the imperial trait, which arms them with the sceptre of the globe. It is this ,vhich lies at the foundation of that aristocratic character, which certainly wanders into strange vagaries, so that its origin is often lost sight of, but which, if it should lose this, would find itself para ... lyzed; and in trade and in the mechanic's shop, gives that hon- esty in performance, that thoroughness and solidity of work which is a national characteristic. This conscience is one element, and the other is that loyal adhesion, that habit of friendship, that homage of man to man, running through all classes-the electing of worthy persons to a certain fra terni ty, to acts of kindness and warm and stanch support, from year to year, from youth to age-which is alike lovely and honorable to those who render and those who receive it; which", "of man to man, running through all classes-the electing of worthy persons to a certain fra terni ty, to acts of kindness and warm and stanch support, from year to year, from youth to age-which is alike lovely and honorable to those who render and those who receive it; which stands in strong contrast with .# ENGLISH TRAITS the superficial attachments of other races, their excessive cour- tesy and short-lived connection. You will think me very pedantic, gentlemen, but holiday though it be, I haVe not the smallest interest in any holiday' e.\"{cept as it celebrates real and not pretended joys; and I think it just, in this time of gloom and commercial disaster, of afflic ... tion and beggary in these districts, that, on these very accounts I speak of, you should !lot fail to keep your literary anniversary. I seem to hear you say, that for all that is come and gone yet, we will not reduce by one chapl~t or one oak-leaf the braverie~ of our annual feast. For I must tell you, I was given to under- stand in my childhood that the British island from which my forefathers came was no lotus-garden, no paradise of serene sky and roses and music and merriment all the year round, no, but a cold, foggy, mournful country, where nothing grew well in the open air but robust men and virtuous women, and these of a wonderful fibre and endurance; that their best parts were slowly' revealed; their virtues did not come out until they quarrelled; they did not strike twelve the first time; good lovers,., good haters, and you could know little about them till you had seen them long, and little good of them till you had seen them in action; that in prosperity they were moody", "did not come out until they quarrelled; they did not strike twelve the first time; good lovers,., good haters, and you could know little about them till you had seen them long, and little good of them till you had seen them in action; that in prosperity they were moody and dumpish, but in adversity they were grand. Is it not true, sir, that the wise an .. cients did not praise the ship parting with flying colors from the port, but only that brave sailor which came back with torn sheets and battered sides, stript of her banners, but having rid .. den out the storm? And so, gentlemen, I feel in regard to this aged England, with the possessions, honors and trophies, and also with the infirmities of a thousand years gathering around her, irretrievably committed as she now is to ll1any old customs which cannot be suddenly changed; pressed upon by the transi- tions of trade and new and all incalculable modes, fabrics, arts, machines and cOlnpeting populations. I see her not dispirited, not weak, but well remembering that she has seen dark days before-indeed with a kind of instinct that she sees a little better in a cloudy day, and that in storm of battle and calamity she has a secret vigor and a pulse like a cannon. I see her in 690 ENGLISH TRAITS her old age, not necrepit, but young and still daring to believe in her power of endurance and expansion. Seeing this, I say, All hail! mother of nations, mother of heroes, with strength still equal to the time; still wise to entertain and swift to execute . the policy which mind and heart of mankind requires in the present hour, and thus only hospitable to the foreigner and truly a borne", "I say, All hail! mother of nations, mother of heroes, with strength still equal to the time; still wise to entertain and swift to execute . the policy which mind and heart of mankind requires in the present hour, and thus only hospitable to the foreigner and truly a borne to the thoughtful and generous who are born in the soil. So be it! so let it be! If it be not so, if the courage of England goes with the chances of a commercial crisis, I will go back to the capes of Massachusetts and my own Indian stream, and say to my countrymen, the old race are all gone, and the elasticity and hope of mankind must henceforth remain on the Alleghany ranges, or nowhere .. CONDUCT OF LIFE [Conduct of Life was published in 1860. Most of the material in this book had served as a course oj lec- tures, fi1~st in Pittsburgh in 1851, later in Boston and then at various places throughout the country. By this time Emerson was well known everywhere in America and was in constant demand. He was travel- ing extensively in the East and in the Middle West, which was then a raw and growing part of the coun- try. The period between his return from England in 1848 and the publication oj this book in 1860 was full of great political unrest and Emerson was un\u00b7 willingly drawn into it. Conduct of Life was well re ceived and sold rapidly.

As SOON as a stranger is introduced into any company, one of the first questions which all wish to have answered, is, How does that man get his living? And with reason. He is no whole 693 WEALTH man until he knows how to carn a blameless livelihood. Society is barbarous until every industrious man can get his living with .. out dishonest customs. Every man is a consumer, and ought to be a producer. He fails to make his place good in the world unless he not only pays his debt but also adds something to the common wealth. Nor can he do justice to his genius without making some larger demand on the world than a bare subsistence. He is by constitution expen .. sive, and needs to be rich. Wealth has its source in applications of the mind to nature, from the rudest strokes of spade and axe up to the last secrets )f art. Intimate ties subsist between thought and all production; because a better order is equivalent to vast amounts of brute labor. rr:he forces and the resistances are nature's, but the mind acts in bringing things from where they abound to where they are wanted; in wise combining; in directing the practice of the useful arts, and in the creation of finer values by fine art, by eloquence, by song, or the reproductions of", "and the resistances are nature's, but the mind acts in bringing things from where they abound to where they are wanted; in wise combining; in directing the practice of the useful arts, and in the creation of finer values by fine art, by eloquence, by song, or the reproductions of memory. Wealth is in applications of mind to nature; and the art of getting rich consists not in industry, much less in saving, but in a better order, in timeliness, in being at the right spot. One man has stronger arms or longer legs; another sees by the course of streams and growth of markets where land will be wanted, makes a clearing to the river, goes to sleep and wakes up rich. Steam is no stronger now than it was a hundred years ago; but is put to better use. A clever fellow was acquainted with the expansive force of steanl; he also saw the wealth of wheat and grass rotting in Michigan. Then he cunningly screws on the steam-pipe to the wheat-crop. Puff now, 0 Steam! The steam puffs and expands as before, but this time it is rlragging all ~1ichigan at its back to hungry New York and hungry England. Coal lay in ledges under the ground since the Flood, until a laborer with pick and windlass brings it to the surface. We may well call it black diamonds. Every basket is power and civilization. For coal is a portable climate. It carries the heat of the tropics to Labrador and the polar circle; and it is the means of transporting itself whithersoever it is wantedg CONDUCT OF LIFE Watt and Stephenson whispered in the ear of mankind their secret, that a halj ... ounce of coal will draw two tons a mile, and coal carries coal,", "tropics to Labrador and the polar circle; and it is the means of transporting itself whithersoever it is wantedg CONDUCT OF LIFE Watt and Stephenson whispered in the ear of mankind their secret, that a halj ... ounce of coal will draw two tons a mile, and coal carries coal, by rail and by boat, to make Canada a~ warnl as Calcutta; and with its comfort brings its industrial power .. When the farn1er's peaches are taken from under the tree and carried into town, they have a new look and a hundredfold value over the fruit which grew on the saIne bough and lies fulsomely on the ground. The craft of the n1erchant is this bringing a thing from where it abounds to where it is costly. Wealth begins in a tight roof that keeps the rain and wind out; in a good pump that yields you plenty of sweet water; in two suits of clothes, so to change your dress when you are wet; in dry sticks to burn, in a good double-wick lamp, and three meals; in a horse or a locomotive to cross the land, in a boat to cross the sea; in tools to work with, in books to read; and so in giving on all sides by tools and auxiliaries the greatest possible exten ... sion to our powers; as if it added feet and hands and eyes and blood, length to the day, and knowledge and good will. Wealth begins with these articles of necessity. And here We must recite the iron la,v which nature thunders in these northern climates.

And here We must recite the iron la,v which nature thunders in these northern climates. First she requires that each man should feed himsel[ If happily his fathers have left him no inheritance, he must go to work, and by making his wants less or his gains more, he must draw hitnself out of that state of pain and insult in which she forces the beggar to lie. She gives him no rest until this is done; she starves, taunts and torments him, takes away warmth, laughter, sleep, friends and daylight, until he has fought his way to his own loaf. Then, less peremptorily but still with sting enough, she urges him to the acquisition of such things as belong to him. Every warehouse and shop-window, every fruit-tree, every thought of every hour opens a new want to him which it concerns his power and dignity to gratify. It is of no use to argue the wants down: the philosophers have laid the greatness of man in n1aking his wants few, but \\f\\,-ill a man content himself with a hut and a handful of dried pease? He is born to be rlch4 He is thoroughly related; and is tempted out by his appetites and fancies to the conquest of this and that piece of natllre~ 69C WEALTH until he finds his well-being in the use of his planet, and of more planets than his own. Wealth requires, besides the crust of bread and the roof-the freedom of the city, the freedom of the earth, travelling, machinery, the benefits of science, music and fine arts, the best culture and the best company. He is the rich man who can avail himself of all men's faculties.

He is the richest fi'lan who knows how to draw a benefit from the labors of the greatest number of men, of men in distant countries and in past times. The same correspondence that is between thirst in the stomach and water in the spring, exists between the whole of man and the whole of nature. The elements offer their service to him. The sea, washing the equator and the poles, offers its perilous aid and the power and empire that follow it-day by day to his craft and audacity. \"Beware of me,\" it says, \"but if you can hold me, I am the key to all the lands.\" Fire offers, on its side, an equal power. Fire, steam, lightning, gravity, ledges of rock, mines of iron, lead, quicksilver, tin and gold; forests of all woods; fruits 01 all climates; animals of all habits; the powers of tillage; the fa~rics of his chemic laboratory; the webs of his loom; the mascu~ine draught of his locomotive; the talismans of the machine-shop; all grand and subtile 'things, minerals, gases, ethers, passions, war, trade, government-are his natural play- mates, and according to the excellence of the machinery in each human being is his attraction for the instruments he is to em- ploy.

The strong race is strong on these terms. The Saxons are the ~erchants of the world; now, for a thousand years, the leading race, and by nothing more than their quality of personal inde- pendence, and in its special modification, pecuniary indepen- dence. No reliance for bread and games on the government; no cianship, no patriarchal style of living by the revenues of a -:hief, no marrying-on, no system of clientship suits them; but ~very man must pay his scot. The English are prosperous and peaceable, with their habit of considering that every man must CONDUCT OF LIFE take care of himself and has himself to thank if he do not main- tain and improve his position in society. The subject of economy mixes itself with morals, inasmuch as it is a peremptory point of virtue that a mall's independence be secured. Poverty demoralizes. A man in debt is so far a slave, and Wall Street tllinks it easy for a millionaire to be a man of his word, a man of honor, but that in failing circumstances no man can be relied on to keep his integrity. And when one ob .. serves in the hotels and palaces of our Atlantic capitals the habit of expense, the riot of the senses, the absence of bonds, clanship, fellow-feeling of any kind-he feels that when a man or a woman is driven to the wall, the chances of integrity are frightfuIJy diminished; as if virtue were coming to be a luxury which few' could afford, or, as Burke said, \"at a market almost too high for humanity.\" I-Ie", "fellow-feeling of any kind-he feels that when a man or a woman is driven to the wall, the chances of integrity are frightfuIJy diminished; as if virtue were coming to be a luxury which few' could afford, or, as Burke said, \"at a market almost too high for humanity.\" I-Ie may fix his inventory of necessities and of enjoyments on what scale he pleases, but if he wishes the power and privilege of thought, the chalking out his own career and having society on his own terms, he must bring his wants within his proper power to satisfy. The manly part is to do with might and main what you can do. The world is full of fops who never did anything and who had persuaded beauties and men of genius to wear their fop livery; and these will deliver the fop opinion, that it is nnt respectable to be seen earning a living; that it is much more respectable to spend without earning; and this doctrine of tht: snake will come also from the elect sons of light; for wise men are not wise at all hours, and will speak five times from their taste or their humor, to once from their reason. The brave work- man, who might betray his feeling of it in his manners, if he do not succumb in his practice, n1ust replace the grace or elegance forfeited, by the merit of the work done.

The artist has made his picture so true that ;t WEALTH disconcerts criticism. The statue is so beautiful that it contracts no stain from the market, but makes the market a silent gallery for itself. The case of the young lawyer was pitiful to disgust- a paltry matter of buttons or tweezer-cases; but the determined youth saw in it an aperture to insert his dangerous wedges, made the insignificance of the thing forgotten, and gave fame by his sense and energy to the name and affairs of the Tittleton snuff .. box factory. Society in large towns is babyish, and wealth is made a toy. The life of pleasure is so ostentatious that a shallow observer must believe that this is the agreed bes~ use of wealth, and, what ... ever is pretended, it ends in cosseting. But if this were the main use of surplus capital, it would bring us to barricades, burned towns and tomahawks, presently. Men of sense esteem wealth to be the assimilation of nature to themselves, the converting of the sap and juices of the planet to the incarnation and nutriment of their design. Power is what they want, not candy-power to execute their design, power to give legs and feet, form and actual- ity to their thought; which, to a clear-sighted man, appears the end for which the universe exists, and all its resources might be w-ell applied.

Columbus thinks that the sphere is a problem for practical navigation as well as for closet geometry, and looks on all kings and peoples as cowardly landsmen until they dare fit ~im out. Few men on the planet have more truly belonged to it. But he was forced to leave much of his map blank. His successors lnherited his map, and inherited his fury to complete it. So the men of the mine, telegraph, mill, map and survey-the monomaniacs who talk up their project in marts and offices and entreat men to subscribe-how did our factories get built? how did North America get netted with iron rails, except by the im- portunity of these orators who dragged all the prudent men in? Is party the madness of many for the gain of a few? This specu- lative genius is the madness of a few for the gain of the world. The projectors are sacrificed, but the public is the gainer. Each of these idealists, working after his thought, would make it tyrannical, if he could. He is met and antagonized by other 3peculators as hot as he. The equilibrium is preserve~ by these CONDUCT OF LIFE 699 counteractions, as one tree keeps down another in the forest, that it may not absorb all the sap in the ground. And the supply in nature of railroad-presidents, copper-nliners, gra.nd-junction- ers, smoke-burners, fire-annihilators, etc., is limited by the samr. law which keeps the proportion in the supply of carbon, of aluln, and of hydrogen.

To be rich is to have a ticket of adnlission to the master-works and chief men of each race. It is to have the sea, by voyaging; to visit the mountains, Niagara, the Nile, the desert, Rome, Paris, Constantinople; to see galleries, libraries, arsenals, manufacto- ries. The reader of Hurnboldt's Cosmos foHows the marches of a man whose eyes, ears and mind are armed by all the science, arts and implements which mankind have anywhere accumu .. lated, and who is using these to add to the stock. So it is with Denon, Beckford, Belzoni, Wilkinson, Layard, Kane, Lepsius and Livingstone. \"The rich man,\" says Saadi, \"is everywhere expected and at home.\" The rich take up something more of the world into man's life. They include the country as well as the town, the ocean-side, the White Hills, the Far West and the old European homesteads of man, in their notion of available material. The w()rld is his who has money to go' over it. Hf. arrives at th~ seashore and a sumptuous ship has floored and carpeted for him the stormy Atlantic, and made it a luxurious hotel, amid the horrors of tempests. The Persians say, \" 'T is the same to him who wears a shoe, as if the whole earth wert' covered with leather.\" Kings are said to have long arms, but every man should have long arms, and should pluck his living, his instruments, his power. and his knowing, from the sun, moon and stars.

Is not then the demand to be rich legitimate? Yet I have never seen a rich man. I have never seen a man as rich as all men ought to be, or with an adequate command of nature. The pulpit and the press havf, many commonplaces denouncing the thirst for wealth; but if men should take these moralists at their word and leave oft aiming to be rich, the moralists would rush to rekindle at aU hazards this love of power in the people, lest civilization shoulci be undone. Men are urged by their ideas to acquire the com ... 700 WEALTH mand over nature. Ages derive a culture from the wealth of Roman Cresars, Leo Tenths, magnificent Kings of France, Grand Dukes of Tuscany, Dukes of Devonshire, Townleys, Vernons and Peels, in England; or whatever great proprietors. It is the interest of all men that there should be Vaticans and Louvres full of noble works of art; British Museums, and French Gardens of Plants, Philadelphia Academies of Natural History, Bodleian, Ambrosian, Royal, Congressional Libraries. It is the interest of all that there should be Exploring Expeditions; Captain Cooks to voyage round the world, Rosses, Franklins, Ricbardsons and Kanes, to find the magnetic and the geographic poles.

Whilst it is each man's interest that not only ease and con- venience of living, but also wealth or surplus product should exist somewhere, it need not be in his hands. Often it is very undesirable to him. Goethe said well, \"Nobody should be rich but those who understand it.\" Some men are born to own, and can animate all their possessions. Others cannot: their owning is not graceful; seems to be a compromise of their character; they seem to steal their own dividends. They should own who can administer, not they who hoard and conceal; not they who, the greater proprietors they are, are only the greater beggars, but they whose work carves out work for more, opens a path for all.. For he is the rich man in whom the people al'e rich, and he is the poor man in whom the people are poor; and how to give all access to the masterpieces of art and nature, is the problem of civilization. The socialism of our day has done good service in setting men on thinking how certain civilizing benefits, now only enjoyed by the opulent, can be enjoyed by all. For example, the providing to each man the means and apparatus of science and of the arts. There are many articles good for occa- sional use, which fevi men are able to own.

There are many articles good for occa- sional use, which fevi men are able to own. Every man wishes to see the ring of SatuI\\J, the satellites and belts of Jupiter and 701 Mars, the mountains and craters in the moon; yet how few can buy a telescope! and of those, scarcely one would like the trouble of keeping it in order and exhibiting it. So of electrical and chemical apparatus, and many the like things. Every man may have occasion to consult books which he does not care to possess, such as cyclopedias, dictionaries, tables, charts, maps and other public documents; pictures also of birds, beasts, fishes, spells, trees, flowers, whose f:lames he desires to know. There is a refining influence from the arts of Design on a pre- pared mind which is as positive as that of music, and nf>t to be c;upplied from any other source. But pictures, engravings, statues and casts, beside their first cost, entail expenses, as of galleries and keepers for the exhibition; and the use which any man can make of them is rare, and their value too is much en .. hanced by the numbers of men who can share their enjoyment. In the Greek. cities it was reckoned profane that any person should pretend a property in a work of art, which belonged to all who could behold it. I think sometimes, could I only have music on my own terms; could I live in a great city and know where I could go whenever I wished the ablution and inunda- tion of musical waves-that were a bath and a medicine. If properties of this kind were owned by states, towns and lyceums, they would", "have music on my own terms; could I live in a great city and know where I could go whenever I wished the ablution and inunda- tion of musical waves-that were a bath and a medicine. If properties of this kind were owned by states, towns and lyceums, they would draw the bonds of neighborhood closer. A town would exist to an intellectual purpose. In Europe, where the feudal form~ secure the permanence of wealth in certain families, those families buy and preserve these things and lay them open to the public. But in America, where democratic insti- tutions divide every estate into small portions after a few years, the public should step into the place of these proprietors, and pro .. vide this culture and inspiration for the citizens. Man was born to be rich, or inevitably grows rich by the use of his faculties; by the union of thought with nature. Property is an intellectual production. The game requires coolness, right reasoning, promptness and patience in the players. Cultivated iabor drives out brute labor. An infinite number of shrewd men, in infinite years, have arrived at certain best and shortest ways of doing, and this accumulated skill in. arts, CUltures, harvestings, 702 \\VEALTH curings, manufactures, navigations, exchanges, constitutes the worth of our world to-day. Commerce is a game of skill, which every man cannot play, which few men can play well. The right merchant is one who has the just average of faculties we call common-sense,. a man of a strong affinity for facts, who makes up his decision on what he has seen.

The problem is to combine many and remote operations with the accuracy and adherence to the facts which is easy in near and small transactions; so to arrive at gigantic results, without any compromise of safety. Napoleon was fond of telling the story of the Marseilles banker who said ta his visitor, surprised at the contrast between the splendor of the banker's chateau and hospitality and the meanness of the counting-room in which he had seen him-\"Young man, you are too young to understand how masses are formed; the true and only power, whether composed of money, water or men; it is all alike; a mass is an immense centre of motion, but it must be begun, it must be kept up\"-and he might have added that the way in which it must be begun and kept up is by obedience to the law of particles.

Political Economy is as good a book wherein to read the life of man and the ascendancy of laws over all private and hostile influences, as any Bible which has come down to us. Money is representative, and follows the nature and fortunes of the owner. The coin is a delicate meter of civil social and , CONDUCT OF LIFE moral changes. The farmer is covetous of his dollar, and with reason. It is no waif to him. He knows how many strokes of labor it represents. His bones ache with the days' work that earned it. He knovvs how much land it represents-how much rain, frost and sunshine. He knows that, in the dollar, he gives you so much discretion and patience, so much hoeing and threshing. Try to lift his dollar; you must lift all that weight. In the city, where money follows the skit of a pen or a lucky rise in ~xchange, it comes to be looked on as light. I wish the farnler held it dearer1 and would spend it only for real bread; force for force. The farmer's dollar is heavy and the clerk's is light and nimble; leaps out of his pocket; jumps on to card and faro-tables: but still more curious is its susceptibility to Inetaphysical changes.

Forty years ago, a dollar would not buy much in Boston .. N ow it will buy a great deal more in our old towns, thanks to railroads, telegraphs, steamers, and the contemporaneous growth of New York and the whole country_ Yet there are many goods appertaining to a capital city which are not yet purchasable here, no, not with a mountain of dollars. A dollar in Florida is not worth a dollar in Massachusetts. A dollar is not value, but repre- sentative of value, and, at last, of nloral values.

The Bank-Note Detector is a useful publication. But the cur- rent dollar, silver or paper, is itself the detector of the right and 'wrong where it circulates. Is it not instantly enhanced by the increase of equity? If a trader refuses to sell his vote, or adheres to some odious right, he makes so much more equity in Massa- ~husetts; and every acre in the state is more worth, in the hour ~f his action. If you take out of State Street the ten honestest merchants and put in ten roguish persons controlling the same amount of capital, the rates of insurance will indicate it; the soundness of banks will show it; the highways will be less secure; the schools will feel it, the children will bring home their little dose of the poison; the judge will sit less firmly on the bench, and his decisions be less upright; he has lost so much support and constraint, which all need; and the pUlpit will betray it, in a laxer rule of life.

And if you should take out of the powerful class engaged in trade a hundred good men and put in a hundred bad, or, what is just the same thing, introduce a demoralizing institution, would not the dollar, which is not much stupider than an apple-tree, presently find it out? The value of a dollar is social, as it is created by society. Every man \\\\o\"ho removes into this city with any purchasable talent or skill in him, gives to etrery man's labor in the city a new worth. If 2 talent is anywher(~ born into the world, the community of nation-, is enriched; and much more with a new degree of probity. The expense of crime, one of the principal charges of every nation, is so far stopped. In Europe, crime is observed to increase or abate with the price of bread. If the Rothschilds at Paris do not accept bills, the people at Manchester, at Paisley, at Birming- ham are forced into the highway, and landlords are shot down in Ireland.

Your paper is not fine or coarse enough-is too heavy, or too thin. The manufacturer says WEALTH . he will furnish you with just that thickness or thinness you want; the pattern is quite indifferent to him; here is his schedule-any variety of paper, as cheaper or dearer, with the prices annexed. A pound of paper costs so much, and you may have it made up in any pattern you fancy. There is in all our dealings a self-regulation that supersedes chaffering. You will rent a house, but must have it cheap. The owner can reduce the rent, but so he incapacitates himself from making proper repairs, and the tenant gets not the house he would have, but a worse one; besides that, a relation a little injur- ious is established between landlord and tenant.

Who but must wish that all labor and value should stand on the sanle simple and surly market? If it is the best of its kind, it will. We must have joiner, locksmith, planter, priest, poet, doctor, cook, weaver, ostler; each in turn, through the year. If a St. Michael's pear sells for a shilling, it costs a shilling to raise it. If, in Boston, the best securities offer twelve per cent. for money, they have just six per cent. of insecurity. You may not see that the fine pear costs you a shilling, but it costs the com- munity so much. The shilling represents the number of enemies the pear has, and the amount of risk in ripenjng it. The price of coal shows the narrowness of the coal-field, and a compulsory confinement of the miners to a certain district. All salaries are ~eck.oned on contingent as well as on actual services. \"If the wind were always southwest by west,\" said the skipper, \"women might take ships to sea.\" One might say that all things are of one price; that nothing is cheap or dear, and that the apparent disparities that strike us are only a shopman's trick of concealing the damage in your bargain.

The ancient poet said, \"The gods sell all things at a fair price.\" There is an example of the compensations in the commercial history of this country. When the European wars threw the carrying-trade of the world, from 1800 to 18I2, into American bottoms, a seizure was now and then made of an American ship_ Of course the loss was serious to the owner: but the country was indemnified; for we charged threepence a pound for carrying cotton, sixpence for tobacco, and so on; which paid for the risk and loss, and brought into the country an immense prosperity, early marriages, private wealth, the building of cities and of states; and after the war was over, we received compensation over and above, by treaty, for all the seizures.

Britain, France and Germany, which our extraordinary profits had im- poverished, send out, attracted by the fame of our advantages, first their thousands, then their millions of poor people, to share the crop. At first we employ them, and increase our prosperity; but in the artificial system of society and of protected labor\" which we also have adopted and enlarged, there come presently checks and stoppages. Then we refuse to employ these poor men. But they will not be so answered. They go into the poor-rates, and though we refuse wages, we must now pay the same amount in the form of taxes. Again, it turns out that the largest propor- tion of crimes are committed by foreigners. The cost of the crime and the expense of courts and of prisons we must bear, and the standing army of preventive police we must pay. The cost of education of the posterity O,f this great colony, I will not com- pute.

There are few measures of economy which will bear to be named without disgust; for the subject is tender and we may easily have too much of it, and therein resembles the hideous animalcules of which our bodies are built up-which, offensive in the particular, yet compose valuable and effective masses. Our nature and genius force us to respect ends, whilst we use means. \\Ve must use the means, and yet, in our most accurate using somehow screen and cloak them, as we can only give them any beauty by a reflection of the glory of the end. That is the good head, which serves the end and commands the means. The rabble are corrupted by their means; the means are too strong for them, and they desert their end. I. The first of these measures is that each man's expense must proceed from his character. As long as your genius buys, the :.nvestment is safe, though you spend like a monarch. Nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other, and thus makes him necessary to society_ This native determination guides his labor and his spending. He wants an equipment of means and tools proper to his talent. And to save on this point were to neutralize the special strength and helpfulness of each mind. Do your work, respecting the excellence of the work, and not its acceptableness. This is so much economy that, rightly read, it is the", "equipment of means and tools proper to his talent. And to save on this point were to neutralize the special strength and helpfulness of each mind. Do your work, respecting the excellence of the work, and not its acceptableness. This is so much economy that, rightly read, it is the sum of economy_ Profligacy consists not in spending years of tinle or chests of money-but in spending them off the line of your career. The crime which bankrupts men and states is job-work-declining from your main design, to serve a turn here or there. Nothing is beneath you, if it is in the direction of your life; nothing is great or desirable if it is off from that. I think. we are entitled here to draw (L straight line and say that society can never prosper but CONDUCT OF LIFE must always be bank.rupt, until every man does that 'vvhich he was created to do. Spend for your expense, and retrencL the expense which is not vours. Allston the painter was wont to say that he built a plain 01 house, and filled it with plain furniture, because he would hold out no bribe to any to visit him who had not similar tastes to his own. We are sympathetic, and, like children, want everything we see. But it is a large stride to independence, when a man, in the discovery of his proper talent, has sunk the necessity for false expenses. As the betrothed maiden by one secure affection is relieved from a system of slaveries-the daily inculcated neces ... .sity of pleasing all--so the man who has found what he can do, can spend on that and leave all other spending. Montaigne said, \"When he was a younger brother, he went brave in dress and equipage, but afterward", "is relieved from a system of slaveries-the daily inculcated neces ... .sity of pleasing all--so the man who has found what he can do, can spend on that and leave all other spending. Montaigne said, \"When he was a younger brother, he went brave in dress and equipage, but afterward his chateau and farms might answer for him.\" Let a man who belongs to the class of nobles, those namely who have found out that they can do something, relieve himself of all vague squandering on objects not his. Let the realist not mind appearances. Let him delegate to others the costly courtesies and decorations of social life. The virtues are economists, but some of the vices are also. Thus, next to hunlil ... ity, I have noticed that pride is a pretty good husband. A good pride is, as I reckon it, worth fronl five hundred to fifteen hun ... dred a year. Pride is handsome, economical; pride eradicates so many vices, letting none subsist but itself, that it seems as if it were a great gain to exchange vanity for pride. Pride can go without domestics, without fine clothes, can live in a house with two rooms, can eat potato, purslain, beans, lyed corn, can work on the soil, can travel afoot, can talk with poor men, or sit silent well contented in fine saloons. But vanity costs money, labor, horses, men, wOlnen, health and peace, and is still nothing at last; a long way leading nowhere. Only one drawback; proud .Jeople are intolerably selfish, and the vain are gentle and giving.

We had hI this region, twenty years ago, among our educated men, a sort of Arcadian fanaticism~ a passionate desire to go upon the land and unite farming to in- tellectual pursuits. Many effected their purpose and made the experiment, and some became downright ploughn1en; but all were cured of their faith that scholarship and practical farming (I mean, with one's own hands) could be united. \"\"\"'ith brow bent, with firm intent, the pale scholar leaves his desk to draw a freer breath and get a juster statement of his thought, in the garden-walk. He stoops to pull up a purslain or a dock that is choking the young corn, and finds there are two; close behind the last is a third; he reaches out his hand to a fourth, behind that are four thousand and one. He is heated and untuned, and by and by wakes up from his idiot dream of chick- weed and red-root, to remember his morning thought, a.nd to find that with his adamantine purposes he has been duped by a dandelion. A garden is like those pernicious machineries we read of every month in the newsp8:pers, which catch a man's coat-skirt or his hand and draw in his arm, his leg and his whole body to irresistible destruction.

Every tree and graft, every hill of melons, row of corn, or quickset hedge; all he has done and all be n1eans to do, stand in his way like duns, when he would go out of his gate. The devotion to these vines and trees he finds poisonous. Long free walks, a circuit of miles, free his brain and serve his body. Long marches are no hardship to him. He be- lieves he composes easily on the hills. But this pottering in a few square yards of garden is dispiriting and drivelling. The smell of the plants has drugged him and robbed him of '=!nergy. He finds a catalepsy in his bones. He grows peevish and poor .. spirited. The genius of reading and of gardening are antagonistic, like resinous and vitreous electricity. One is concentrative in sparks and shocks; the other is diffuse strength; so that each disqualifies its workman for the other's duties.

Spend after your genius, and by syste1'Jz. Nature goes by rule, not by sallies and saltations. There must be system in the economies. Saving and unexpensiveness will not keep the most pathetic family from ruin, nor will bigger incomes make free spending safe. The secret of success lies never in the amount of money, but in the relation of income to outgo; as, after expense has been fixed at a certain point, then new and steady rills of income, though never so slnall, being added, wealth begins. But in ordinary, as means increase, spending increases faster, so that large incomes, in England and elsewhere, are found not to help matters-the eating quality of debt does not relax its voracity .. When the cholera is in the potato, what is the use of planting larger crops?

A systenl must be in every economy, or the best single expedi ... ents are of no avail. A farm is a good thing when it begins and ends with itself, and does not need a salary or a shop to eke it out. Thus, the cattle are a main link in the chain-ring. If the non-conformist or resthetic farmer leaves out the cattle and does not also leave out the want which the cattle must supply, he must fill the gap by begging or stealing. When men now alive were born, the farm yielded everything that was consumed on it. The farm yielded no money, and the farmer got on without.

If he fell sick, his neighbors came in to his aid; each gave a day's work~ or a half day; or lent his yoke of oxen, or his horse, and kent his 'work even; hoed his potatoes, mo\\ved his hay, reaped his rye; well knowing that no man could afford to hire labor without selling his land. In autumn a farmer could sell an ox or a hog and get a little money to pay taxes withal. Now, the farmer buys almost all he consumes-tinware, cloth, sugar, tea, coffee, fish, coal, railroad tickets and newspapers. A master in each art is required, because the practice is never with still or dead subjects, but they change in your hands. You think. farm buildings and broad acres a solid property; but its value is flowing like water. It requires as much watching as if yon were decanting wine from a cask. The farmer knows what to do with it, stops every leak, turns all the streamlets to one reser- voir and decants wine; but a blunderhead comes out of Cornhill, tries his hand, and it all leaks aflay. So is it with granite streets or timber townships as with fruit or flowers. Nor is any invest- ment so permanent that it can be allowed to remain without incessant watching, as the history of each attempt to lock up an inheritance through two generations for an unborn inheritor may show. ,\"Vhen Mr. Cockayne takes a cottage in the country, and will keep his cow, be thinks a cow is a creature that is fed on hay and gives a pail of milk", "history of each attempt to lock up an inheritance through two generations for an unborn inheritor may show. ,\"Vhen Mr. Cockayne takes a cottage in the country, and will keep his cow, be thinks a cow is a creature that is fed on hay and gives a pail of milk twice a day.

Perhaps he bought also a yoke of oxen to do his work; but they get blown and lame. What to do with blown and lame oxen? The farmer fats his after the spring work is done, and kills them in the fall. But how can Cockayne, who has no pastures, and leaves his cottage daily in the cars at business hours, be pothered with fatting and killing oxen? He plants trees; but there must be crops, to keep the trees in ploughed land. What shall be the crops? He will have nothing to do with trees, but will have grass. After a year or two the grass must be turned up and ploughed; now what crops? Credulous Cockayne! 3. Help comes in the custom of the country, and the rule of Impera parendo. The rule is not to dictate nor to insist on carry .. ing out each of your schemes by ignorant wilfulness, but to learn practically the secret spoken from all nature, that things them- selves refuse to be mismanaged, and will show to the watchful their own law.

The stone- mason who should build the well thinks he shall have to dig forty feet; the baker doubts he shall never like to drive up to the door; the practical neighbor cavils at the position of the barn; and the citizen comes to know that his predecessor the farmer built the house in the right spot for the sun and wind, the spring, and water-drainage, and the convenience to the pasture, the garden, the field and the road.

So Dock Square yields the point, and things have their own way. Use has made the farmer wise, and the foolish citizen learns to take his counsel. From step to step he comes at last to surrender at discretion. The farmer affects to take his orders; but the citizen says, You may ask me as often as you YVill, and in what ingenious forms, for an opinion concern- ~ me mode of building my wall, or sinking my well, or laying oCt my acre, but the ball will rebound to you. These are matters on which I neither know nor need to know anything.

'T is in vain that genius or virtue or energy of character strive and cry against it. This is fate. And 't is very well that the poor husband reads in a book of a new way of liv- ing, and resolves to adopt it at home; let him go home and try it, if he dare. 4.

Hotspur lives for the ~loment, praises himself for it, and despises Furlong, that he does not. Hotspur of course is poor, and Furlong a good provider. The odd circumstance is that Hotspur thinks it a superiority in himself, this improvidence, which ought to be rewarded with FLlrlong's lands. I have not at all completed my d'\u00b7sign. But we must not leave the topic without casting one glanc!:': into the interior recesses. It is a doctrine of philosophy that man is a being of degrees; that there is nothing in the world which is not repeated in his body, his body being a sort of miniature 0:- summary of the world; then that there is nothing in his body vlhich is not repeated as in a celestial sphere in his mind; then, there is nothing in his brain which is not repeated in a higher sphere in his moral system .. 5. Now these things are so in natcre. All things ascend, and the royal rule of economy is that it sho'J.ld ascend also, or, whatever we do must always have a higher eim. Thus it is a maxim that money is another kind of blood, P~!cunia alter sanguis: or, the estate of a man is only a larger k~.nd of body, and admits of regimen analogous to his bodily circu la tions. So there is no maxim of the merchant which does not admIt of an", "a maxim that money is another kind of blood, P~!cunia alter sanguis: or, the estate of a man is only a larger k~.nd of body, and admits of regimen analogous to his bodily circu la tions. So there is no maxim of the merchant which does not admIt of an extended sense, e. g., \"Best use of money is to pay debts\"; \"<Every business by itself\"; \"Best time is present time\"; ~'The right investment is in tools of your trade\"; and the like. The counting-room maxims liberally expounded are laws of the universe. The merchant's economy is a coarse symbol of the soul's economy. It is to spend for power \"'I6 I WEALTH .and not for pleasure. It is to invest income; that is to say, to take up particulars into generals; days into integral eras-liter- ary, emotive, practical-of its life, and still to ascend in its invest .. mente The merchant has but one rule, absorb and invest; he is to be capitalist; the scraps and filings must be gathered back into the crucible; the gas and smoke Inust be burned, and earnings must not go to increase expense, but to capital again. Well, the man must be capitalist. Will he spend his income, or will he invest? His body and every organ is under the same law. His body is a jar in which the liquor of life is stored. Will he spend for pleasure? The way to ruin is short and facile. Will he not spend but hoard for power? It passes through the sacred fermen- ~tions, by that law of nature whereby everything climbs to -hig1:ler platforms, and bodily vigor becomes mental and moral -vigor. The bread he eats is first strength and animal spirits; it 1becomes, in higher laboratories, imagery and thought; and in still", "hoard for power?

The bread he eats is first strength and animal spirits; it 1becomes, in higher laboratories, imagery and thought; and in still higher results, courage and endurance. This is the right compound interest; this is capital doubled, quadrupled, cen .. tupled; man raised to his highest power. The true thrift is always to spend on the higher plane; to invest and invest, with keener avarice, that he may spend in spiritual creation and not in augmenting animal existence. Nor is the man enriched, in repeating the old experiments of animal sensation; nor unless through new powers and ascending pleasures he knows himself by the actual experience of higher good to be already on the way to the highest. CULTURE Can rules or tutors educate The semigod whom we await? He must be musical, Tremulous, impressional, Alive to gentle influence Of landscape and of sky, And tender to the spirit-touch Of man's or maiden's eye: But, to his native centre fast, Shall into Future fuse the Past, And the world's flowing fates in his own mould recast. \u2022 llHE word of ambition at the present day is Culture. Whilst all the world is in pursuit of power, and of wealth as a means of power, culture corrects the theory of success. A man is the prisoner of his power. A topical memory makes him an almanac; a talent for debate, a disputant; skill to get money makes him a miser, that is, a beggar. Culture reduces these inflammations by invoking the aid of other powers against the dominant talent, and by appealing to the rank of powers. It watches success. For performance, nature", "him an almanac; a talent for debate, a disputant; skill to get money makes him a miser, that is, a beggar. Culture reduces these inflammations by invoking the aid of other powers against the dominant talent, and by appealing to the rank of powers. It watches success. For performance, nature has no mercy, and sacrifices the perfonner to get it done; makes a dropsy or a tympany of him. If she wants a thumb, she makes one at the cost of arms and legs, and any excess of power in one part is usually paid for at once by some defect in a contiguous part. Our efficiency depends so much on our concentration, that nature usually in the instances where a marked man is sent into the world, overloads him with bias, sacrificing his symmetry to his working power. It is said a man can write but one book; and if a man have a defect, it is apt to leave its impression on all his performances. If she creates a policelnan like Fouche, he is made up of suspicions and of plots to circumvent them. \"The air,\" said Fouche, \"is full of poniards.\" The physician Sanctorius spent his life in a pair of scales, weighing his food. Lord Coke valued ~I7 CULTURE Chaucer highly because the Canon Yeman's Tale illustrates the statute fifth Hen. IV chap. 4, against alchemy. I saw a man who believed the principal mischiefs in the English state were derived from the devotion to n1usical concerts. A freemason, not long since, set out to e~lllain to this country that the principal cause of the success of General Washington was the aid he derived from the freemasons.

A freemason, not long since, set out to e~lllain to this country that the principal cause of the success of General Washington was the aid he derived from the freemasons. But worse than the harping on one string, nature has secured individualism by giving the private person a high conceit of his weight in the system. The pest of society is egotists. There are dull and bright, sacred and profane, coarse and fine egotists. It is a disease that like influenza falls on all constitutions. In the dis- temper known to physicians as chorea, the patient son1etimes turns round and continues to spin slowly on one spot. Is egotism a metaphysical variety of this malady? The man runs round a ting formed by his own talent, falls into an admiration of it, and loses relation to the world. It is a tendency in all minds. One of its annoying forms is a craving for sympathy. The sufferers parade their miseries, tear the lint from their bruises, reveal their indictable crimes, that you may pity them. They like sickness, because physical pain will extort some show of interest from the bystanders, as we have seen children who finding themselves of no account when grown people come in, will cough till they choke, to draw attention. This distemper is the scourge of talent-of artists, inventors and philosophers. Eminent spiritualists shall have an incapacity 1)f putting their act or word aloof from them and seeing it bravely for the nothing it is .. Beware of the man who says, \"1 am on the eve of a revelation.\" It is speedily punished, inasmuch as this habit invites men to humor it, and, by treating the patient ten- derly, to shut him up in a narrower selfism and exclude him from the great world", ".. Beware of the man who says, \"1 am on the eve of a revelation.\" It is speedily punished, inasmuch as this habit invites men to humor it, and, by treating the patient ten- derly, to shut him up in a narrower selfism and exclude him from the great world of God's cheerful fallible men and women. Let us rather be insulted, whilst we are insultable. Religious litera- ture has eminent examples, and if we run over our private list of poets, critics, philanthropists and philosophers, we shall find them infected with this dropsy and elephantiasis, which we ought to have tapped. CONDUCT OF LIFE This goitre of egotism is so frequent among notable persons that we must infer SOine strong necessity in nature which it sub- serves; such as we see in the sexual attraction. The preservation of the species was a point of such necessity that nature has secured it at all hazards by immensely overloading the passion, at the risk of perpetual crime and disorder. So egotism has its root in the cardinal necessity by which each individual persists to be what he is. This individuality is not only not inconsistent with culture, but is the basis of it. Every valuable nature is there in its own right, and the student we speak to must have a mother-wit invincible by his .:ulture-which uses all books, arts, facilities, and elegan ... cies of intercourse, but is never subdued and lost in them. He only is a well-made man who has a good deterlnination. And the end of culture is not to destroy this, God forbid! but to train away all impediment and mixture and leave nothing but pure power. Our student must have a style and determination, and be a master in his own specialty. But having this,", "who has a good deterlnination. And the end of culture is not to destroy this, God forbid! but to train away all impediment and mixture and leave nothing but pure power. Our student must have a style and determination, and be a master in his own specialty. But having this, he must put it behind him. He must have a catholicity, a power to see with a free and disengaged look every object. Yet is this private interest and self so overcharged that if a man seeks a companion who can look at objects for their own sake and without affection or self .. reference, he will find the fewest who will give him that satisfac ... tion; whilst most men are afflicted with a coldness, an incuriosity r as soon as any object does not connect with their self-love. Though they talk of the object before them, they are thinking of themselves, and their vanity is laying little traps for your admiration. But after a man has discovered that there are linlits to the interest which his private history has for mankind, he still con- verses with his family, or a few companions-perhaps with half a dozen personalities that are famous in his neighborhood. In Boston the question of life is the names of some eight or ten men. Have you seen Mr. Allston, Doctor Channing, Mr. Adams~ Mr. Webster, Mr. Greenough? Have you heard Everett, Garri- son, Father Taylor, Theodore Parker? Have you talked with Messieurs Turbinewheel, Summitlevel, and Lacofrupees? Thel1 120 CULTUl<E you may as well die.

Have you seen a few lawyers, merchants and brokers-two or three scholars, two or three capitalists, two or three editors oi newspapers? New York is a sucked orange. All conversation is at an end when we have discharged ourselves of a dozen personalities, domestic or imported, which make up our American existence. Nor do we expect anybody to be other than a faint copy of these heroes. Life is very narrow. Bring any club or company of intelligent men together again after ten years, and if the presence of some penetrating and calming genius could dispose them to frankness, what a confession of insanities would come up! The \"causes\" to whicn we have sacrificed, Tariff or Democracy, Whigism or Abolition, Temperance or Socialism would show like roots of bitterness and dragons of wrath; and our talents are as mis- chievous as if each had been seized upon by some bird of prey which had -whisked him away from fortune, from truth, from the near society of the poets-some zeal, some bias, and only when he was now gray and nerveless was it relaxing its claws and he awaking to sober perceptions. Culture is the suggestion, from certain best thoughts, that a man has a range of affinities through which he can modulate the violence of any master .. tones that have a droning preponderance in his scale, and succor him against himself. Culture redresses his balance, puts him among his equals and superiors, revives the delicious sense of sympathy and warns him of the dangers of solitude and repulsion. It is not a compliment but a disparagement to consult a man only on horses, or on", "scale, and succor him against himself.

It is not a compliment but a disparagement to consult a man only on horses, or on steam} or on theatres, or on eating, or on books, and, whenever he appears, considerately to turn the con- versation to the bantling he is known to fondle. In the NC'rse heaven of our forefathers, Thor's house had five hundred and forty floors; and man's house has five hundred and forty floors. Eis excellence is facility of adaptation and of transition, through many reiated points, to wide contrasts and extremes. Culture kills his exaggeration, his conceit of his village or his city. We must leave our pets at home when we go into the street, and CONDUCT OF LIFE 72 1 meet men on broad grounds of good meaning and good sense. No performance is worth loss of geniality. 'T is a cruel price we pay for certain fancy goods called fine arts and philosophy . .in the Norse legend, All-fadir did not get a drink of Mimir's spring (the fountain of wisdom) until he left his eyes in pledge. And here is a pedant that cannot unfold his wrinkles, nor conceal his wrath at interruption by the best, if their con .. versation do not fit his impertinency-here is he to afflict us with his persunalities. 'T is incident to scholars that each of them fancies he is pointedly odious in his community. Draw him out of this limbo of irritability. Cleanse with healthy blood his parch .. ment skin.

Draw him out of this limbo of irritability. Cleanse with healthy blood his parch .. ment skin. You restore to him his eyes which he left in pledge at Mimir's spring. If you are the victim of your doing, who cares what you do? We can spare your opera, your gazetteer, your chemic analysis, your history, your syllogisms. Your man of genius pays dear for his distinction. His head runs up into a spire, and, instead of a healthy man, merry and wise, he is some mad dominie. Nature is reckless of the individual. When she bas points to carry, she carries them. To wade in marshes and sea- margins is the destiny of certain birds, and they are so accurately made for this that they are imprisoned in those places. Each ani .. mal out of its habitat would starve. To the physician, each man, each woman, is an amplification of one organ. A soldier, a lock- smith, a bank-clerk and a dancer could not exchange functions. And thus we are victims of adaptation. The antidotes against this organic egotism are the range and variety of attractions, as gained by acquaintance with the world, with men of merit, with classes of society, with travel, with eminent persons, and with the high resources of philosophy, art and religion ~ books, travel, society, solitude. The hardiest skeptic who has seen a horse broken, a pointer trained, or who has visited a menagerie or the exhibition of the Industrious Fleas, will not deny the validity of education. \"A boy,\" says Plato, \"is the most vicious of all wild beasts\"; and in the same spirit the old English poet Gascoigne says, \"A boy is better unborn than untaught.\" The", "who has visited a menagerie or the exhibition of the Industrious Fleas, will not deny the validity of education. \"A boy,\" says Plato, \"is the most vicious of all wild beasts\"; and in the same spirit the old English poet Gascoigne says, \"A boy is better unborn than untaught.\" The city breeds one kind of speech and manners; the back country a different style; the sea an- /22 CULTURE other; the army a fourth. We know that an army which can be confided in may be formed by discipline; that by sy::tematic dis- cipline all men may be made heroes: Marshal Lannes said to a French officer, \"I(now, Colonel, that none but a poltroon will boast that he never was afraid.\" A great part of courage is the ,:ourage of having done the thing before. And in all human action those faculties will be strong which are used. Robert Owen said, \"Give me a tiger, and I will educate him.\" 'T is inhuman to want Iaith in the power of education, since to meliorate is the law ot nature; and men are valued precisely as they exert onward or meliorating force. On the other hand, poltroonery is the ac- knowledging an inferiority to be incurable. Incapacity of melioration is the only mortal distemper. There are people who can never understand a trope or any second or expanded sense given to your words, or any humor; but remain literalists, after hearing the music and poetry and rhetoric and wit of seventy or eighty years. They are past the help of sur .. Jeon ur clergy. But even these can understand pitchforks and the cry of Fire! and I have noticed in some of this class a marked dislike of earthquakes.

But even these can understand pitchforks and the cry of Fire! and I have noticed in some of this class a marked dislike of earthquakes. Let us make our education brave and preventive. Politics is an after-work, a poor patching. We are always a little late. The evil is done, the law is passed, and we begin the uphill agitation for repeal of that of which we ought to have prevented the enact- ing. We shall one day learn to supersede politics by education. What we call our root-and-branch reforms, of slavery, war, gambling, intemperance, is only medicating the symptoms. We must begin higher up, namely in Education. Our arts and tools give to him who can handle them much the same advantage over the novice as if you extended his life, ten, fifty, or a hundred years .. A.nd I think it the part of good sense to provide every fine soul with such culture that it shall not, at thirty or forty years, have to say, 'This which I might do is made hopeless through my want of weapons.' But it is conceded that much of our training fails of effect; that an success is hazardous and rare; that a large part of our cost and pains is thrown away_ N\"ature takes the matter into her CONDUCT OF LIFE own hands, and though we must not omit any jot of our system. we can seldom be sure that it has availed much, or that as much good would not have accrued from a different system. .

Books, as containing the finest records of human wit, must always enter into our notion of culture. The best heads that ever existed, Pericles, Plato, Julius Cresar, Shakspeare, Goethe, Mil .. ton, were well-read, universally educated men, and quite too wise to undervalue letters. Their opinion has weight, because they had means of knowing the opposite opinion. We look that a great man should be a good reader, or in proportion to the spon- taneous power should be the assimilating power. Good criticism is very rare and always preciotls. I am always happy to meet persons who perceive the transcendent superiority of Shakspeare over all other writers. I IH~e people who like Plato. Because this love does not consist with self-conceit. But books are good only as far as a boy is ready for them. He sometimes gets ready very slowly. You send your child to the schoolmaster, but 't is the schoolboys who educate him. You send him to the Latin class, but much of his tuition comes, on his way to school, from the shop-windows. You like the strict rules and the long terms; and he finds his best leading in a by-way of his own, and refuses any companions but of his own choosing. He hates the grammar and Gradus, and loves guns, fishing-rods, horses and boats. Well, the boy is rjght, and you are not fit to direct his bringing-up if your theory leaves out his gymnastic training.

Archery, cricket, gun and fishing-rod, horse and boat, are all educators, liberalizers; and so are de ncing, dress and the street talk; and provided only the boy has resources, and is of a noble and ingenuous strain, these will not serve him less than the books. He learns chess, whist, dancing and theatricals. The father observes that another boy has learned algebra and geom- etry in the same time. But the first boy has acquired much more than these poor games along with them. He is infatuated for weeks with whist and chess: but presently will find out, as you did, that when he rises from the game too long played, he is vacant and forlorn and despises himself. T~enceforward it takes place with other things, and has its due weight in his experience. These; CULTURE minor skills and accomplishments, for example, dancing, are tickets of admission to the dress-circle of mankind, and the being master of them enables the youth to judge intelligently of much on which otherwise he would give a pedantic squint. Landor said, \"I have suffered more from my bad dancing than from all the misfortunes and miseries of my life put together.\" Provided always the boy is teachable (for we are not proposing to make a statue out of punk), football, cricket, archery, swimming, skat- ing, climbing, fencing, riding, are lessons in the art of power, which it is his main business to learn-riding, specially, of which Lord Herbert of Cherbury said, \"A good rider on a good horse is as much above himself and others as the world can make him.\" Besides, the gun, fishing-rod, boat and horse, constitute, among all who use them, secret freemasonries.

They are as if they belong to one club. There is also a negative value in these arts. Their chief use to the youth is not amusement, but to be known for what they are, and not to remain to him occasions of heart-burn. Weare full of superstitions. Each class fixes its eyes on the advantages it has not; the refined, on rude strength; the democrat, on birth and breeding. One of the benefits of a college education is to show the boy its little avail. I knew a leading man in a leading city, who, having set his heart on an education at the university and missed it, could never quite feel himself the equal of his own brothers who had gone thither. His easy superiority to multi- tudes of professional men could never quite countervail to him this imaginary defect. Balls, ricling, wine-parties and billiards pass to a poor boy for something fine and romantic, which they are not; and a free admission to them on an equal footing, if it were possible, only once or twi~e, would be worth ten times its cost, by undeceiving him. I am not much an advocate for travelling, and I observe that men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own, and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places. For the most part, only the light characters traveL 'Vho are you that have no task to keep you at borne?

For the most part, only the light characters traveL 'Vho are you that have no task to keep you at borne? I have been quoted as saying captious things about travel; CONDUCT OF LIFE but I mean to do justice. I think there is a restlessness in our people which argues want of character. All educated Americans, first or last, go to Europe; perhaps because it is their mental home, as the invalid habits of this country might suggest. An eminent teacher of girls said, \"the idea of a girl's education is, whatever qualifies her for going to Eur.ope.\" Can we never ex ... tract this tape-worm of Europe from the brain of our country ... men? One sees very well what their fate must be. He that doe!' not fill a place at home, cannot abroad. He only goes there to. hide his insignificance in a larger crowd. Yov do not think you will find anything there which you have not seen at home? The stuff of all countries is just the same. Do you suppose there is any country where they do not scald milk-pans, and swaddle the infants, and burn the brushwood, and broil the fish? What is true anywhere is true everywhere. And let hiIn go where he will, he can only find so much beauty or worth as he carries. Of course, for some men, travel may be useful. Naturalists, discoverers and sailors are born. Some men are made for couriers, exchangers, envoys, missionaries, bearers of despatches, as others are for farmers and workingmen.

And if the man is of a light nnd social turn, and nature has aimed to make a legged and winged creature) frained for locomotion, we must follow her hint and furnish him with that breeding which gives currency, as sedur \u2022 lou sly as with that which gives worth. But Jet us not be pedantic, but allow to travel its full effect. The boy grown up on a farm, which he has never left, is said in the country to have had 110 chance, and boys and men of that condition look upon work on a railroad, or drudgery in a city, as opportunity. Poor country boys of Vermont and Connecticut formerly owed what knowl\u00b7 edge they had to their peddling trips to the Southern States. California and the Pacific Coast is now the university of this class, as Virginia was in old times. 'To have some chance' is their word. And the phrase 'to know the world,' or to travel, is synony .. mous with all Inen's ideas of advantage and superiority. No doubt, to a man of sense, travel offers advantages. As many languages as he has, as many friends, as many arts and trades, so many times is he a man. A foreign country is a point of com, CULTURE paris on Nherefrom to judge his own.

And, as a medical remedy, travel seems one of the best. Just as a man witnessing the admirable effect of ether to lull pain, and meditating on the :~ontingencies of wounds, cancers, lockjaws, rejoices in Dr. Jackson's benign discovery, so &. man who looks at Paris, at Naples. or at London, says, 'If I should be driven from my own home here at least my thoughts can oe consoled by the most prodigal amusement and occupation ~Vhlc.:h the human race in ages could contrive and accumulate.' ~kin to the benefit of foreign travel, the resthetic value of railroads is to unite the advantages of town and country life, neither of which we can spare. A man should live in or near a large town, because, let his own genius be what it may, it will repel quite as much of agreeable and valuable talent as it draws, and, in a city, the total attraction of all the citizens is sure to conquer, first or last, every repulsion, and drag the most im- probable hermit within its", "his own genius be what it may, it will repel quite as much of agreeable and valuable talent as it draws, and, in a city, the total attraction of all the citizens is sure to conquer, first or last, every repulsion, and drag the most im- probable hermit within its walls some day in the year. In town be can find the swimming-school, the gymnasium, the dancing- master, the shooting-gallery, opera, theatre and panorama; the chemist's shop, the museum of natural history; the gallery of fine arts; the national orators, in their turn; foreign travellers, the libraries and his club. In the country he can find solitude and reading, manly labor, cheap living and his old shoes; moors for game, hills for geology and groves for devotion. Aubrey writes, \"1 have heard Thomas Hobbes say, that, in the Earl of Devon's house, in Derbyshire, there was a good library and books enough for him, and his lordship stor.ed the library with what books he CONDUCT OF LI]'E thought fit to be bought. But the want of good conversation was a very great inconvenience, and, though he conceived he could order his thinking as well as another, yet he found a great defect. In.the country, in long time, for want of good conversation, one's understanding and invention contract a moss on them, like an old paling in an orchard.\" Cities give us collision. It is said, London and New York take the nonsense out of a man. A great part of our education is sym- pathetic and social. Boys and girls who have been brought up with well-informed and superior people show in their manners an inestimable grace.

Fuller says that \"WIlliam, Earl of Nassau, won a subject from the King of Spain, every time he put off his hat.\" You cannot have one well ... bred man without a whole society of such. They keep each other up to any high point. Especially women; it requires a great many cultivated women-saloons of bright, elegant, reading women, accustomed to ease and refine ... ment, to spectacles, pictures, sculpture, poetry, and to elegant society-in order that you should have one Madame de Stael. The head of a commercial house or a leading lawyer or politician is brought into daily contact with troops of men from all parts of the country, and those too the driving-wheels, the business men of each section, and one can hardly suggest for an apprehen\u00b7 sive man a more searching culture. Besides, we must remembet the high social possibilities of a million of men. The best brib~ which London offers to-day to the imagination is that in such a vast variety of people and conditions one can believe there is room for persons of romantic character to exist, and that the poet, the mystic and the hero may hope to confront their counterparts. I wish cities could teach their best lesson-of quiet manners. It is the foible especially of American youth-pretension. The: mark of the man of the world is absence of pretension. He does~ not make a speech, he takes a low business-tone, avoids all brag: is nobody, dresses plainly, prolnises not at all, performs much, speaks in monosyllables, hugs his fact.

His conversation clings to the weather a.nd the news; yet he allows himself to be surprised into thou'5bt ann the nnIoek .. CULTURE ing of his learning and philosophy. How the imagination is piqued by anecdotes of some great man passing incognito, as a king in gray clCDthes; of Napoleon affecting a plain suit at his glittering levee; of Burns or Scott or Beethoven or Wellington or Goethe, or any container of transcendent power, passing for nobody; of Epaminondas, \"who never says anything, but will listen eter- nally\"; of Goethe, who preferred trifling subjects and common expressions in intercourse with strangers, worse rather than bet ... ter clothes, and to appear a little more capricious than he was. There are advantages in the old hat and box-coat. I have heard that throughout this country a certain respect is paid to good broadcloth; but dress makes a little restraint; men will not com- mit themselves. But the box-coat is like wine, it unlocks the tongue, and men say what they think. An old poet says- \"Go far and go sparing, For you'll find it certain, The poorer and the baser you appear, The more you'll look through still.\" Not muc:b otherwise lVli1nes writes in the \"Lay of the Humble\"- LITo me men are for what they are, They wear no masks with me.\" It is odd that our people should have-not water on the brain, but a little gas there.

A shrewd foreigner said of the Americans that \"whatever they say has a little the air of a speech.\" Yet one of the traits down in the books as distinguishing the Anglo-Saxon is a trick of self-disparagement. To be sure, in old, dense coun- tries, among a million of good coats a fine eoa t comes to be no distinction, and you find humorists. In an English party a man with no marked manners or features, with a face like red dough, unexpectedly discloses wit, learning, a wide range of topics and personal familiarity with good men in all parts of the world, until you think you have fallen upon some illustrious personage. Can it be that the American forest has refreshed some weeds of old Pictish barbarism just ready to die out-the love of the scar- let feather, of beads and tinsel? The Italians are fond of red CONDUCT OF LIFE clothes, peacock plumes and embroidery; and I rem~Ihber one rainy morning in the city of Palermo the street was in a blaze with scarlet umbrellas. The English have a plain taste. The equipages of the grandees are plain. A gorgeous livery indicates new and awkward city wealth. Mr. Pitt, like Mr. Pym, thought the title of Mister good against any king in Europe. They have piqued themselves on governing the whole world in the poor, plain, dark Committee-room which the House of Commons sat in, before the fire.

They have piqued themselves on governing the whole world in the poor, plain, dark Committee-room which the House of Commons sat in, before the fire. Whilst we want cities as the centres where the best things are found, cities degrade us by magnifying trifles. The countryman finds the town a chop-house, a barber's shop. He has lost the lines of grandeur of the horizon, hills and plains, and with them sobriety and elevation. He has come among a supple, glib- tongued tribe, who live for show, servile to public opinion. Life is dragged down to a fracas of pitiful cares and disasters. You say the gods ought to respect a life whose objects are their own; buf in cities they have betrayed you to a cloud of insignificant annoy ances- \"Mirmidons, race feconde, Mirmidons, Enfin nous commandons: Jupiter livre Ie monde Aux mirmidons, aux mirmidons.\" 'T is heavy odds Against the gods, When they will match with myrmidons.

What is odious but noise, and people who scream and bewail? people whose vane points always east, who live to dine, who send for the doctor, who coddle themselves, who toast their feet on the register, who intrigue to secure a padded chair and a corner out of the draught.

Let us learn to live coarsely, dress plainly, and lie hard. The least habit of dominion over the palate has certain good effects not easily esti- mated. Neither will we be driven into a quiddling abstemious- ness. 'T is a superstition to insist on a special diet. All is made at last of the same chemical atoms. A man in pursuit of greatness feels no little wants. How can you mind diet, bed, dress, or salutes or compliments, or the figure you make in company, or wealth, or even the bringing things to pass-when you think how paltry are the machinery and the workers? \\Vordsworth was praised to me in Westmore- land for having afforded to his country neighbors an example of a modest household where comfort and culture were secured without display. And a tender boy who wears his rusty cap a.nd outgrown coat, that he may secure the coveted place in college and the right in the library, is educated to some pur- pose. There is a great deal of self-denial and manliness in poor and middle-class houses in town and country, that has not got into literature and never will, but that keeps the earth sweet; that saves on superfluities, and spends on essentials; that goes rusty and educates the boy; that sells the horse but builds the school; works early and late, takes two looms in the factory, three looms, six looms, but pays off the mortgage on the paternal farm, and then goes back cheerfully to work again.

We can ill spare the commanding social benefits of cities; they must be used, yet cautiously and haughtily-and will yield their best values to him who best can do without them. Keep the town for occasions, but the habits should be formed to retire- ment. Solitude, the safeguard of mediocrity, is, to genius, the stern friend, the cold, obscure shelter where moult the wings which will bear it farther than suns and stars. He who should inspire and lead his race must be defended from travelling with the souls 1)f other men, from living, breathing, reading and writing in the daily, time-worn yoke of their opinions. \"In the CONDUCT OF LIFE 73 I morning-solitude\"; said Pythagoras; that nature may speak to the imagination, as she does never in company, and that her favorite may make acquaintance with those divine strengths which disclose themselves to serious and abstracted thought. 'T is very certain that Plato, Plotinus, Archimedes, Hermes, NewtoR, Milton, Wordsworth, did not live in a crowd, but descended into it from time to time as benefactors; and the wise instructor will press this point of securing to the young soul in the disposition of time and the arrangements of living, periods and habits of solitude.

The more I know you, the more I dissatisfy and must dissatisfy all my wonted companions. Their very presence stupefies me .. The common understanding withdraws itself from the one centre of all existence.\" Solitude takes off the pressure of present importunities, that more catholic and humane relations may appear. The saint and poet seek privacy to ends the most public and universal, and it is the secret of 'culture to interest the man more in his public than in his private quality. Here is a new poem, which elicits a good many comments in the journals and in conversa .. tion. From these it is easy at last to gather the verdict which readers passed upon it; and that is, in the main, unfavorable. The poet, as a craftsman, is only interested in the praise ac- corded to him, and not in the censure, though it be just. And the poor little poet hearkens only to that, and rejects the censure as proving incapacity in the critic. But the poet culti- vated becomes a stockholder in both companies-say Mr. Curfew in the Curfew stock, and in the h'ltmanity stock-and, in the last, exults as much in the demonstration of the unsoundness 73 2 CULTURE of Curfew, as", "and rejects the censure as proving incapacity in the critic. But the poet culti- vated becomes a stockholder in both companies-say Mr. Curfew in the Curfew stock, and in the h'ltmanity stock-and, in the last, exults as much in the demonstration of the unsoundness 73 2 CULTURE of Curfew, as his interest in the former gives him pleasure in the currency of Curfew. For the depreciation of his Curfew stock only shows the immense values of the humanity stock. As soon as he sides with his critic against himself, with joy, he is a cuI tiva ted man. We must have an intellectual quality in all property and in all action, or they are naught. I must have children, I must have events, I must have a social state and history, or my thinking and speaking want body or basis. But to give these accessories any value, I must know them as contingent and rather showy possessions, which pass for more to the people than to me. We see this abstraction in scholars, as a matter of course; but what a charm it adds when observed in practical rnen. Bonaparte, like Cresar, was intellectual, and could look at every object for itself, without affection: Though an egotist a \\Jutrance, he could criticise a play, a building, a character, on universal grounds, and give a just opinion. A man known to us only as a celebrity in politics or in trade gains largely in our esteem if we discover that he has some intellectual taste or skill; as when we learn of Lord Fairfax, the Long Parlia- ment's general, his passion for antiquarian studies; or of the 'French regicide Carnot, his sublime genius in mathematics; Dr of a living banker, his success in poetry; or of a partisan journalist, his devotion", "has some intellectual taste or skill; as when we learn of Lord Fairfax, the Long Parlia- ment's general, his passion for antiquarian studies; or of the 'French regicide Carnot, his sublime genius in mathematics; Dr of a living banker, his success in poetry; or of a partisan journalist, his devotion to ornithology. So, if in travelling in the dreary wilderness of Arkansas or Texas we should observe on the next seat a man reading Horace, or Martial, or Calderon, we should wish to hug him, We only vary the phrase, not the doctrine, when we say that culture opens the sense of beauty. A man is a beggar who only lives to the useful, and however he may serve as a pin or rivet in the social machine, cannot be said to have arrived at self- possession. I suffer every day from the want of perception of beauty in people. They do not know the charm with which all 'lnoments and objects can be embellished, the charm of man- ners, of self-command, of benevolence. Repose and cheerful- ness are the badge of the gentleman-repose in energy. The Greek battie-pieces are calm; the heroes, in whatever violent ac- CONDUCT O}\" LIFE 733 tions engage~ retain a serene aspect; as we say of Niagara that it falls without speed. A cheerful intelligent face is the end of culture, and success enough. For it indicates the purpose of nature and wisdom attained. When our higher faculties are in activity we are domesti- cated, and awkwardness and discomfort give place to natural and agreeable movenlents. It is noticed that the considera- tion of the great periods and spaces of astronomy induces a ~ignity of mind and an indifference to death.

It is noticed that the considera- tion of the great periods and spaces of astronomy induces a ~ignity of mind and an indifference to death. The influence of fine scenery, the presence of mountains, appeases our irrita- tions and elevates our friendships. Even a high dome, and the expansive interior of a cathedral, have a sensible effect on manners. I have heard that stiff people lose something of their awkwardness under high ceilings and in spacious halls. I think sculpture and painting have an effect to teach us manners and abolish hurry. But, over all, culture mus~ reinforce from higher influx the empirical skills of eloquence, or of politics, or of trade and the useful arts. There is a certain loftiness of thought and power to marshal and adjust particulars, which can only come from an insight of their whole connection. The orator whc has\u00b7 once seen things in their divine order will never quite lose sight of this, and will come to affairs as from a higher ground, and though he will say nothing of philosophy, he will have a certain mastery in dealing with them, and an incapableness of being dazzled or frighted, which will distinguish his han- dling from that of attorneys and factors. A man who stands on a good footing with the heads of parties at Washington, reads the rumors of the newspapers and the guesses of provincial politicians with a key to the right and wrong in each statement, and sees well enough where all this will end. Archimedes will look through your Connecticut machine at a glance, and judge of its fitness.

Archimedes will look through your Connecticut machine at a glance, and judge of its fitness. And much more a wise man who knows not only what Plato, but what Saint John can show him, can easily raise the affair he deals with to a certain majesty. Plato saySl Pericles owed this elevation to the lessons of Anaxagoras. Burke descended from a higher sphere when he would influence human 734 CULTURE affairs. Franklin, Adams, Jefferson, Washington, stood on a fine humanity, before which the brawls of modern senates are but pot-house politics. But there are higher secrets of culture, which are not for the apprentices but for proficients. These are lessons only for the brave. We must know our friends under ugly masks. The calami- ties are our friends. Ben Jonson specifies in his address to the lYIuse:- \"Get hinl the time's long grudge, the court's ill-will, And, reconciled, keep him suspected still, Mak e him lose all his friends, and what is worse, Almost all ways tG any better course; With me thou leav'~t a better Muse than thee, And which thou brought'st me, blessed Poverty.') We wish to learn philosophy by rote, and play at heroism. But the wiser God says, Take the shame, the poverty and the penal solitude that belong to truth-speaking. Try the rough water as ,veil as the smooth. Rough water can teach lessons worth knowing. When the state is unquiet, personal qualities are more than ever decisive. Fear not a revolution which will constrain you to live five years in one. Don't be so tender at m,ak.ing an enemy now and then. Be willing to go to Coventry' sometimes, and let the populace bestow on you their coldest contempts.", "unquiet, personal qualities are more than ever decisive. Fear not a revolution which will constrain you to live five years in one. Don't be so tender at m,ak.ing an enemy now and then. Be willing to go to Coventry' sometimes, and let the populace bestow on you their coldest contempts. The finished man of the world must eat of every apple once_ He must hold his hatreds also at arm's length, and 110t remember spite. He has neither friends nor enemies, but values men only as channels of power. He who aims high must dread an easy home and popular manners. Heaven sometimes hedges a rare character about with ungainliness and odium, as the burr that protects the fruit. If there is any great and good thing in store for you, it will oot conle at the first or the second call, nor in the shape of fashion, ease, and city drawing .. rooms. Popularity is for dolls. \"Steep and craggy,\" said Porphyry, \"is the path of the gods.\" Open your Marcus Antoninus. In the opinion of the ancients l'\\e ~vas the great man who scorned to shine, and who contested CONDUCT OF LIFE 735 the frowns of fortune. They preferred the noble vessel too late for the tide, contending with winds and waves, dismantled and unrigged, to her companion borne into harbor with colors flying and guns firing. There is none of the social goods that may not be purchased too dear, and mere amiableness must not take rank with high aims and self-subsistency. Bettine replies to Goethe's mother, who chides her disregard of dress-\"lf I cannot do as I have a mind in our poor Frank ... fort, I shall not carry things far.\" And the youth must rate at its true mark the inconceivable levity of local", "with high aims and self-subsistency. Bettine replies to Goethe's mother, who chides her disregard of dress-\"lf I cannot do as I have a mind in our poor Frank ... fort, I shall not carry things far.\" And the youth must rate at its true mark the inconceivable levity of local opinion. The longer we live the more we must endure the elementary exist- ence of men and women; and every brave heart must treat society as a child, and never allow it to dictate. \"All that class of the severe and restrictive virtues,\" said Burke, \"are almost too costly for humanity.\" Who wishes to be severe? Who wishes to resist the eminent and polite, in behalf of the poor, and low, and impolite? And who that dares do it can keep his temper sweet, his frolic spirits? The high virtues are not debonair, but ha.ve their redress in being il .. lustrious at last. What forests of laurel we bring, and the tears of mankind, to those who stood firn1 against the opinion of their contemporariesl The measure of a master is his success in bringing all men round to his opinion twenty years later. Let me say here that ~ulture cannot begin too early. In talking with scholars, I observe that they lost on ruder companions those years of boyhood which alone could give imaginative liter- ature a religious and infinite quality in their esteem. I find too that the chance for appreciation is much increased by being the son of an appreciator, and that these boys who now grow up are caught not only years too late, but t'VQ or three births tOO late, to make the best scholars of. And I think it a presentable motive to a scholar, that, as in an old community a well-born", "son of an appreciator, and that these boys who now grow up are caught not only years too late, but t'VQ or three births tOO late, to make the best scholars of. And I think it a presentable motive to a scholar, that, as in an old community a well-born proprietor is usually found, after the first heats of youth, to be a careful husband, and to feel a habitual desire that the estate shall suffer no harm by his administration, but shall be delivered down to the next heir in as good condi- tion 8.S he received it-so a considerate man will reckon him ... CULTURE self a. subject of that secular melioration by which mankind is mollified, cured and refined; and will shun every expenditure of his forces on pleasure or gain which will jeopardize this social and secular accumulation. The fossil strata show us that Nature began with rudimental forms and rose to the more complex as fast as the earth was fit for their dwelling-place; and that the lower perish as the higher appear. Very few of our race can be said to be yet finished men. We still carry sticking to us some remains of the preceding inferior quadruped organization. \\Ve call these millions men; but they are not yet men. Half engaged in the soil, pawing to get free, man needs all the music that can be brought to dis- engage him. If Love, red Love, with tears and joy; if Want with his scourge; if War with his cannonade; if Christianity with its charity; if Trade with its money; if Art with its port- folios; if Science with her telegraphs through the deeps of space and time can set his dull nerves throbbing, and by loud taps on the tough chrysalis can break", "scourge; if War with his cannonade; if Christianity with its charity; if Trade with its money; if Art with its port- folios; if Science with her telegraphs through the deeps of space and time can set his dull nerves throbbing, and by loud taps on the tough chrysalis can break its walls and let the new creature emerge erect and free-make way and sing prean! The age of the quadruped is to go out, the age of the brain and of the heart is to come in. The time will come when the evil forms we have known can no more be organized. Man's culture can spare nothing, wants all the material. He is to convert all impediments into instruments, all enemies into power. The formidable mischief will only make the more useful slave. And if one shall read the future of the race hinted in the organic effort of nature to mount and meliorate, and the corresponding impulse to the Better in the human being, we shall dare affirm that there is nothing he will not overcome and convert, until at last culture shall absorb the cbaos and gehenna. He will convert the Furies into Muses, and the hells into benefit. SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE [Society and Solitude is the title of a book Emerson published in 1870.

In caves and hollov.r trees he crept And near the 'wolf and panther slept.

In the con- versation that followed, my new friend made some extraordinary confessions. \"Do you not see 'J he said, \"the penalty of learning and that each of these scholars whom you have met at S \u2022 though he were to be the last man, would, like the executioner ill Hood's poem, guillotine the last but one?\" He added many lively renlarks, but his evident earnestness engaged my", "he said, \"the penalty of learning and that each of these scholars whom you have met at S \u2022 though he were to be the last man, would, like the executioner ill Hood's poem, guillotine the last but one?\" He added many lively renlarks, but his evident earnestness engaged my attention, and in the weeks that follo'\\lved we became better acquainted. He ha.d good abilities, a genial telnper and no vices; but he had one de fect-he could not speak in the tone of the people. There ~;vas some paralysis on his will, such that when he met ITIen on com- mon terms he spoke weakly and froln the point, like a flighty girl. His consciousness of the fault made it worse He en\"led every drover and lunlherman in the tavern their manly spf\"ech. He coveted Mirabea.'t's don terrible de la jamiliartte, believing that he whose sympathy goes lowest is the ma.n from whon1 kings have the most to fear. For himself he declared tha.t he could not get enough alone tl) write a letter to a friend. He ~eft the city; he hid himself in lJastures. The solitary river \\vas not solitary enough; the sun and moon put him out. When he bought a house, the first thing he djd was to plant trees. He could not enough conceal hhnself. Sf.t a hroge here; set oak.s there--trees behind trees; above all, set ever,greens, for thpy will heep a secret all the year round. The Inosi agreeable complim~nt yon could pay him was to imply that you had not observed hinl in a house or a street where you had met him.

Whilst he suffered at being seen where he was, he consoled himself with the delicious thought of 739 740 SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE the inconceivable number of places where he was not. All he wished of his tailor was to provide that sober n1ean of color and cut which would never detain the eye for a moment. He went to Vienna, to Smyrna, to London. In all the variety of costulnes, a carnival, a kaleidoscope of clothes, to his horror he could never discover a man in the street who wore anything like his own dress. He would have given his soul for the ring of Gyges. His dismay at his visibility had blunted the fears of mortality. \"Do you think,\" he said, \"I am in such great terror of being shot-I, wh(J. am only waiting to shuffle off my corporeal jacket to slip away into the back stars, and put diameters of the solar system and sidereal orbits between me and all souls-there to wear out ages in solitude, and forget memory itself, if it be possible?\" He had a remorse running to despair of his social gaucheries, and walked miles and miles to get the twitchings out of his face, the starts and shrugs out of his arms and shoulders. God may forgive sins, he said, but awkwardness has no forgiveness in heaven or earth. He admired in Newton not so much his theory of the moon as his letter to Collins, in which he forbade him to insert his name with the solution of the problem in the Philosophical Transactions: \"It would perhaps increase my acquaintance, the thing which I chiefly study to decline.\" These conversations", "in Newton not so much his theory of the moon as his letter to Collins, in which he forbade him to insert his name with the solution of the problem in the Philosophical Transactions: \"It would perhaps increase my acquaintance, the thing which I chiefly study to decline.\" These conversations led me somewhat later to the knowledge of similar cases, and to the discovery that they are not of very infrequent occurrence. Few substances are found pure in nature. Those constitutions which can bear in open day the rough dealing of the world must be of that mean and average structure such as iron and salt, atmospheric air and water. But there are metals, like potassium and sodium, which, to be kept pure, must be kept under naphtha. Such are the talents determined on some spe .. cialty, which a culminating civilization fosters in the heart of great cities and in royal chambers. Nature protects her own work. To the culture of the world an Archimedes, a Newton is indispen- sable; so she guards them by a certain aridity. If these had been good fellows, fond of dancing, port and clubs, we should have had no Theory of the Sphere and no Principia. They had that necessity of isolation which genius feels. Each must stand on his SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE 741 glass tripod if he would keep his electricity. Even Swedenborg, whose theory of the universe is based on affection, and who repro- bates to weariness the danger and vice of pure intellect, is con- strained to rnake an extraordinary exception: \"There are also angels who do not live consociated, but separate, house and house; these dwell in the midst of heaven, because they are the best of angels..\" We have known n1any fine geniuses 'V'Tith that imperfection that they", "of pure intellect, is con- strained to rnake an extraordinary exception: \"There are also angels who do not live consociated, but separate, house and house; these dwell in the midst of heaven, because they are the best of angels..\" We have known n1any fine geniuses 'V'Tith that imperfection that they cannot do anything useful, not so much as write one dean sentence. 'T is worse, and tragic, that no man is fit for society who has fine traits. At a distance he is admired, but bring him hand to hand, he is a cripple. One protects himself by soli- tude, and one by courtesy, and one by an acid, worldly manner --each concealing how he can the thinness of his skin and his incapacity for strict association. But there is no remedy that can reach the heart of the disease but either habits of self-reliance that should go in practice to making the man independent ot the human race, or else a religion of love. Now he hardly seems entitled to marry; for how can he protect a woman, who cannot ~rotect hinaself? We pray to be conventional. But the wary Heaven takes care you shall not be, if there is anything good in you. Dante was very bad company, and was never invited to dinner. l\\1ichael Angelo had a sad, sour time of it. The ministers of beauty are rarely beautiful in coaches and saloons. Columbus discovered no isle or key so lonely as hhnself. Yet each of these potentates saw well the reason of his exclusion. Solitary was he? Why, yes; but his society was limited only by the amount of brain nature appropriated in that age to carryon the government of the world. \"If I stay,\" said Dante, when there was question of going to Rome, \"who", "potentates saw well the reason of his exclusion. Solitary was he? Why, yes; but his society was limited only by the amount of brain nature appropriated in that age to carryon the government of the world. \"If I stay,\" said Dante, when there was question of going to Rome, \"who will go? and if I go, who will stay?\" But the necessity of solitude is deeper than we have said, and is organic. I have seen many a philosopher whose world is large enough for only one person. He affects to be a good companion; but we are still surprising his secret, that he means and needs to impose his system on all the rest. The determination of each is from all the others, like that of each tree up into free space 742 SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE 'T is no wonder, when each has his whole head, our societies should be so smalL Like President Tyler, our party falls from us every day, and we must ride in a sulky at last. Dear heart! take it sadly home to thee-there is no cooperation. We begin with friendships, and all our youth is a reconnoitring and recruit .. ing of the holy fraternity they shall combine for the salvation of men. But so the remoter stars seem a nebula of united light, yet there is no group which a telescope will not resolve; and the dearest friends are separated by impassable gulfs. The coop- eration is involuntary, and is put upon us by the Genius of Life, who reserves this as a part of his prerogative. 'T is fine for us to talk.; we sit and muse and are serene and complete; but the moment we meet with anybody, each becomes a fraction.

'T is fine for us to talk.; we sit and muse and are serene and complete; but the moment we meet with anybody, each becomes a fraction. Though the stuff of tragedy and of romances is in a moral union of two superior persons whose confidence in each other for long years, out of sight and in sight, and against all appear .. ances, is at last justified by victorious proof of probity to gods and men, causing joyful emotions, tears and glory-though there be for heroes this moral union, yet they too are as far off as ever from an intellectual union, and the moral union is for compara- tively low and external purposes, like the cooperation of a ship's company or of a fire-club. But how insular and pathetica1l~T solitary are all the people we know! Nor dare they tell what thel think of each other when they meet in the street. We have a fine right, to be sure, to taunt men of the world with superficial and treacherous courtesies! Such is the tragic necessity which strict science finds under .. neath our domestic and neighborly life, irresistibly driving each adult soul as with whips into the desert, and making our wana covenants sentimental and momentary_ We must infer that the ends of thought were peremptory, if they were to be secured at such ruinous cost. They are deeper than can be told, and belong to the immensities and eternities.

But this banisbment to the rocks and echoes no metaphysics SOCIETY AND SOLItUDE 743 can make right or tolerable. This result is so against nature, sue\\). a LaIf-view, that it must be corrected by a common sense and experience. \"A man is born by the side of his father, and there he remains.\" A man must be clothed with society, or we shall feel a certain bareness and poverty, as of a displaced and unfur- nished member. He is to be dressed in arts and institutions, as well as in body garments. Now and then a man exquisitely made can live alone, and must; but coop up most men and you undo them. \"The king lived and ate in his hall with men, and under- stood men,\" said Selden. When a young barrister said to the late Mr. Mason, \"1 keep my chamber to read Iaw\"-\"Read law!\" replied the veteran, \" 't is in the court-room you must read law.\" Nor is the rule otherwise for literature. If you would learn to write, 't is in the street you must learn it. Both for the vehicle and for the aims of fine arts you must frequent the public square. The people, and not the college, is the writer's home. A scholar is a candle which the love and desire of all men will light.

Never his lands or his rents, but the power to charm the disguised soul that sits veiled under this bearded and that rosy visage is his rent and ration. His products are as needful as those of the baker or the weaver. Society cannot do without cultivated men. As soon as the first wants are satisfIed, the higher wants become hnperative. 'T is hard to mesmerize ourselves, to whip our own top; but through sympathy we are capable of energy and endurance. Con- cert fires people to a certain fury of performance they can rarely reach alone. Here is the use of society: it is so easy with the great to be great; so easy to come up to an existing standard; as easy as it is to the lover to swim to his maiden through waves so bTim before. The benefits of affection are imlnense; and the one event which never loses its romance is the encounter with superior per ... sons on terms allowing the happiest intercourse. It by no means follows that we are not fit for society, because soirees are tedious and because the soiree finds us tedious. A back .. , woodsman, who had been sent to the university, told me that when he heard the best-bred young men at the law-school talk together, he reckoned himself a boor; but whenever he caught 744 SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE them apart, and had one to himself alone, then they were the boors and he the better man. And if we recall the rare hours when we encountered the best persons, we then found ourselves, and then first society seemed to exist.

That was society, though in the transom of a brig or on the Florida Keys. A cold sluggish blood thinks it has not facts enough to the purpose, and must decline its turn in the conversation. But they who speak have no more-have less. 'T is not new facts that avail, but the heat to dissolve everybody's facts. Heat puts you in right relation with magazines of facts. The capital defect of cold, arid natures is the want of animal spirits. They seem a power incredible, as if God should raise the dead. The recluse witnesses what others perform by their aid, with a kind of fear. It is as much out of his possibility as the prowess of Creur-de- Lion, or an Irishman's day's work on the railroad. 'T is said the present and the future are always rivals. Animal spirits constitute the power of the present, and their feats are like the structure of a pyramid. Their result is a lord, a general~ or a boon com- panion. Before these what a base mendicant is Memory with his leathern badge! But this genial heat is latent in all constitutions, and is disengaged only by the friction of society. As Bacon said of manners, \"To obtain them, it only needs not to despise them,\" so we say of animal spirits that they are the spontaneous product of health and of a social habit. \"For hehavior, men learn it, as they take diseases, one of another.\" But the people are t.o be taken in very small doses.

If solitude is proud, so is society vulgar. In society, high advantages are set down to the individual as disqualifications. We sink as easily as we rise, through sympathy. So many men whom I know are degraded by their sympathies; their native aims being high enough, but their relation all too tender to the gross people about them. Men cannot afford to live together on their merits, and they adjust themselves by their demerits-by their love of gos- sip, or by sheer tolerance and animal good nature. They untune and dissipate the brave aspirant. The remedy is to reinforce each of these moods from the other. Conversation will not corrupt us if we come to the assembly in SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE 745 our own garb and speech and with the energy of health to select what is ours and reject what is not. Society we must have; but let it be society, and not exchanging news or eating from the same dish. Is it society to sit in one of your chairs? I cannot go to the houses of my nearest relatives, because I do not wish to be alone. Society exists by chemical affinity, and not otherwise. Put any company of people together with freedom for conver .. sation, and a rapid self-distribution takes place into sets and pairs. The best are accused of exclusiveness. It would be more true to say they separate as oil from water, as children from old people, without love or hatred in the matter, each seeking hi.; like; and any", "conver .. sation, and a rapid self-distribution takes place into sets and pairs. The best are accused of exclusiveness. It would be more true to say they separate as oil from water, as children from old people, without love or hatred in the matter, each seeking hi.; like; and any interference with the affinities would produce con- straint and suffocation. All conversation is a magnetic experi- ment. I know that my friend can talk eloquently; you know that he cannot articulate a sentence: we have seen him in different company. Assort your party, or invite none. Put Stubbs and Coleridge, Quintilian and Aunt Miriam, into pairs, and you make them all wretched. 'T is an extempore Sing ... Sing built in a parlor. Leave them to seek their own mates, and they will be as merry as sparrows. A higher civility will reestablish in our customs a certain rev- erence which we have lost. What to do with these brisk young men who break through all fences, and make themselves at home in every house? I find out in an instant if my companion does not want me, and ropes cannot hold me when my welcome is gone. One would think that the affinities would pronounce them- selves with a surer reciprocity. Here again, as so often, nature delights to put us between ex- treme antagonisms, and our safety is in the skill with which we keep the diagonal line. Solitude is impracticable, and society fatal. We must keep our head in the one and our hands in the other. The conditions are met, if we keep our independence, yet do not lose our sympathy.

But let us not be the SOC lET Y A\u00b7N D SOL I T U D E victims of words. Society and solitude are deceptive names. It is not the circumstance of seeing more or fewer people, but the readiness of sympathy, that imports; and a sound mind will de .. rive its principles from insight, with ever a purer ascent to the sufficient and absolute right, and will accept society as the nat .. ural element in which they are to be applied. FARMING [This essay was first published as one chapter or Society and Solitude. It was originally entitled The Man with the Hoe and was delivered at the Middle .... sex \"Cattleshow\" on September 29, 1858. Concord was mainly a farming country in Emerson's time. His own property consisted of a house and a ten-acre farm which was worked for him by hired labor\" Although Emerson was not a handy man with tools and implements, he enjoyed gardening and took espe~ cial pride in his fruit trees and grapes and occasion .. ally took prizes jor good fruit at tke annual agricul.r lural jairs.] To these men The landscape is an armory of powers, Which, one by one, they know to draw and use.

They harness beast, bird, insect, to their work; They prove the virtues of each bed of rock, And, like the chemist mid his loaded ~ Jars, Dra w from each stratum its adapted use To drug their crops or weapon their arts withal. They turn the frost upon their chemic heap, They set the wind to winnow pulse and grain, They thank the spring-fiood for it.s fertile slime, And on cheap summit-levels of the snow Slide with the sledge to inacc96Sibie woods O'er meadows bottomless. So, year by year, They fight the elements with ele- ments, And by the order in the field disclose The order regnant in the yeoman's brain. What these strong masters wrote at large in miles, I followed in small copy in my acre; For there's no rood has not a star above it; The cordial quality of pear or plum Ascends as gladly in a single tree As in broad orchards resonant with bees; And every atom poises for itself, And for the whole. He planted where the deluge ploughed, His hired hands were wind and cloud; His eyes detect the Gods concealed In the hummf)ck of the f!eld. FARMING THE glory of the farmer is that, in the division of labors, it is bis part to create. All trade rests at last on his primitive activity. He stands close to Nature; he obtains from the earth the bread and the meat. The food which was not, he causes to be.

He stands close to Nature; he obtains from the earth the bread and the meat. The food which was not, he causes to be. The first farmer was the first man, and all historic nobility rests on possession and use of land .. Men do not like hard work, but every man has an exceptional respect for tillage, and a feeling that this is the original calling of his race, that he himself is only excused from it by some circumstance which made him delegate it for a time to other hands. If he have not some skill which recom- mends him to the farmer, some product for which the farmer will give him corn, he must himself return into his due place among the planters. And the profession has in all eyes its ancient charm, as standing nearest to God, the first cause. Then the beauty of Nature, the tranquillity and innocence of the countryman, his independence and his pleasing arts-the care of bees, of poultry, of sheep, of cows, the dairy, the care of hay, of fruits, of orchards and forests, and the reaction of these on the workman, in giving him a strength and plain dignity like the face and manners of Nature-all men ackno,,;}edge. All men keep the farm in reserve as an asylum where, in case of mis- chance, to hide their poverty-or a solitude, if they do not suc- ceed in society. And who knows how many glances of remorse are turned this way from the bankrupts of trade, from mortified pleaders in courts and senates, or from the victims of idleness and pleasure? Poisoned by town life and town vices, the sufferer resolves: 'We1l1 my children, whom I have injured, shall go back to the", "many glances of remorse are turned this way from the bankrupts of trade, from mortified pleaders in courts and senates, or from the victims of idleness and pleasure? Poisoned by town life and town vices, the sufferer resolves: 'We1l1 my children, whom I have injured, shall go back to the land, to be recruited and cured by that which should have been my nursery, and llOW shall be their hospital.' The farmer's office is precise and important, but you must not try to paint him in rose-color; you cannot make pretty compIi~ 749 150 FAR!dING ments to fate and gravitation, whose minister he is. He represents the necessities. It is the beauty of the great economy of the world that makes his comeliness. He bends to the order of the seasons, th~ weather, the soils and crops, as the sails of a ship bend to the wind. He represents continuous hard labor, year in, year out, and small gains. He is a slow person, timed to Nature, and not to city watches. He takes the pace of seasons, plants and chemistry. Nature never hurries: atom by atoln, little by little, she achieves her work. The lesson one learns in fishing, yachting, hunting or planting is the manners of Nature; patience with the delays of wind and sun, delays of the seasons, bad weather, excess or lack of water-patience with the slowness of our feet, with the par- simony of our strength, with the largeness of sea and land we must traverse, etc. The farmer times hinlself to Nature, and acquires that livelong patience which belongs to her ..

Slow, nar- row man, his rule is that the earth shall feed and clothe him; and he must wait for his crop to grow. His entertainments, his liberties and his spending must be on a farmer's scale, and not on a merchant's. It were as false for farmers to use a wholesale and massy expense, as for states to use a minute economy. But if thus pinched on one side, he has compensatory advantages. He is permanent, clings to his land as the rocks do. In the town where I live, farms remain in the same families for seven and eight generations; and most of the first settlers (in 1635), should they reappear on the farms to-day, would find their own blood and names still in possession. And the like fact holds in the surrounding towns. This hard work will always be done by one kind of man; not by scheming speculators, nor by soldiers, nor professors, nor readers of Tennyson; but by men of endurance-deep-chested, long-winded, tough, slow and sure, and timely. The farmer has a great health, and the appetite of health, and means to his end; he has broad lands for his home, wood to burn great fires, plenty of plain food; his milk at least is unwatered; and for sleep, he has cheaper and better and more of it than citizens. He has grave trusts confided to him. In the great household f:'f Nature, the farmer stands at the door of the bread-room, and FARMING weighs to each his loaf. It is for him to say whether men shall marry or not.

It is for him to say whether men shall marry or not. Early marriages and the number of births are in- dissolubly connected with abundance of food; or, as Burke said, \"Man breeds at the mouth.\" Then he is the Board of Quarantine. The farmer is a hoarded capital of health, as the farm is the capital of wealth; and it is from him that the health and power, moral and intellectual, of the cities came. The city is always re .. cruited from the country. The men in cities who are the centres of energy, the driving-wheels of trade, politics or practical arts, and the women of beauty and genius, are the children or grand .. , children of farmers, and are spending the energies which theh fathers' bardy, silent life accumulated in frosty furrows, in pov- erty, necessity and darkness. He is the continuous benefactor. He who digs a well, con ... structs a stone fountain, plants a grove of trees by the roadside, plants an orchard, builds a durable house, reclaims a swamp, or so much as puts a stone seat by the wayside, makes the land so far lovely and (lesirable, makes a fortune which he cannot carry away with him, but which is useful to his country long afterwards. The man that works at home helps society at large with somewhat more of certainty than he who devotes himself to charities. If it be true that, not by votes of political parties but by the eternal laws of political economy, slaves are driven out of a slave state as fast as it is surrounded by free states, then the true abolitionist is the", "certainty than he who devotes himself to charities. If it be true that, not by votes of political parties but by the eternal laws of political economy, slaves are driven out of a slave state as fast as it is surrounded by free states, then the true abolitionist is the farmer, who, heedless of laws and constitutions, stands all day in the field, investing his labor in the land, and making a product with which no forced labor can compete. We commonly say that the rich man can speak the truth, can afford honesty, can afford independence of opinion and action- and that is the theory of nobility. But it is the rich man in a true sense, that is to say, not the man of large income and large expenditure, but solely the Inan whose outlay is less than bis income and is steadily kept so. In English factories, the boy that watches the 100m, to tie the thread when the wheel stops to indicate that a thread is broken, is called a minder. And in this great factory of our Coper- 752 FARMING nican globe, shifting its slides, rotating its constellations, times and tides, bringing now the day of planting, then of watering, then of weeding, then of reaping, then of curing and storing- the farmer is the minder. His machine is of colossal proportions; the diameter of the water .. wheel, the arms of the levers, the power of the battery, are out of all mechanic measure; and it takes him long to understand its parts and its working. This pump never \"sucks; \" these screws are never loose; this machine is never out of gear; the vat and piston, wheels and tires, never wear out, but are self-repairing.

This pump never \"sucks; \" these screws are never loose; this machine is never out of gear; the vat and piston, wheels and tires, never wear out, but are self-repairing. Who are the farmer's servants? Not the Irish, nor the coolies, but Geology and Chemistry, the quarry of the air, the water of the brook, the lightning of the cloud, the castings of the worm, the plough of the frost. Long before he was born, the sun of ages decomposed the rocks, mellowed his land, soaked it with light and heat, covered it with vegetable film, then with forests, and accumulated tb~ sphagnum whose decays made the peat of his meadow. Science has shown the great circles in which Nature works; the manner in which marine plants balance the marine animals, as the land plants supply the oxygen which the animals consume, and the animals the carbon which the plants absorb. These ac-' tivities are incessant. Nature works on a method of all for each and each for all. The strain that is made on one point bears on every arch and foundation of the structure. There is a perfect solidarity. You cannot detach an atom from its holdings, or strip off from it the electricity, gravitation, chemic affinity or the relation to light and heat and leave the atom bare. No, it brings with it its universal ties. Nature, like a cautious testator, ties up her estate so as not to bestow it all on one generation, but has a forelooking tenderness and equal regard to the next and the next, and the fourth and the fortieth age. There lie the inexhaustible magazines.

There lie the inexhaustible magazines. The eter- nal rocks, as we call them, have held their oxygen or lime un- diminished, entire, as it was. No particle of oxygen can rust or wear, but has the same energy as on the first morning. The good i-ock.s, those patient waiters, say to him: 'We have the sacred FARMINC:r 753 power as \"'''c received it. We have not failed of our trust, dnd now -,vhen in our imnlense day the hour is at last struck-take the gas we have hoarded, mingle it with water, and let it be free ~o gro\\v in plants and animals and obey the thought of man.' The earth works for him; the earth is a machine which yields .1hn~st gratuitous service to every application of intellect. Every plant is a manufacturer of soil. In the stomach of the plant de- velopment begins. The tree can draw on the whole air, the whole earth, on all the rolling main. The plant is all suction .. pipe- imbibing from the ground by its root, from the air by its leaves, with all its might. The air works for him. The atmosphere, a sharp solvent, drinks the essence and spirit of every solid on the globe-a menstruum which melts the mountains into it. Air is matter subdued by heat. As the sea is the grand receptacle of all rivers, so the air is the receptacle from which all things spring, and into which they all return. The invisible and creeping air takes form and solid mass. Our senses are skeptics, and believe only the im- pression of the moment,", "As the sea is the grand receptacle of all rivers, so the air is the receptacle from which all things spring, and into which they all return. The invisible and creeping air takes form and solid mass. Our senses are skeptics, and believe only the im- pression of the moment, and do not believe the chemical fact that these huge mountain chains are made up of gases and rolling wind. But Nature is as subtle as she is strong. She turns hel capital day by day; deals never with dead, but ever with quick subjects. All things are flowing, even those that seem immovable. The adamant is always passing into smoke. The plants imbibe the materials which they want from the air and the ground. They burn, that is, exhale and decompose their own bodies into the air and earth again. The animal burns, or undergoes the like perpetual consumption. The earth burns, the mountains burn and decompose, slower, but incessantly. It is almost inevi- table to push the generalization up into higher parts of Nature, rank over rank into sentient beings. Nations burn with internal fire of thought and affection, which wastes while it works. We shall find finer combustion and finer fuel. Intellect is a fire: rash and pitiless it melts this wonderful bone-house which is called man. Genius even, as it is the greatest good, is the greatest barm. Whilst all thus burns-the universe in a blaze kindled from the torch of the sun-it needs a perpetual tempering, a 754 1I'ARMING phlegm, a sleep, atmospheres of azote, deluges of water, to che~. the fury of the conflagration; a hoarding to check the spending, a centripetence equal to the centrifugence; and this is invariably supplied.

The railroad cErt-cars are good excavators, but there is no porter like Gravitation, who will bring down any weights which man cannot carry, and if he wants aid, knows where to find his fellow laborers. Water works in masses, and sets its irresistible shoulder to your mills or your sb ips, or transports vast boulders of rock. in its iceberg a thousand miles. But its far greater power depends on its talent of becoming little, and entering the smallest holes and pores. By this agency, carrying in solution elements needful to every plant, the vegetable world exists. But as I said, we must not paint the farmer in rose-colore Whilst these grand energies have wrought for him and made his task possible, he is habitually engaged in small economies, and is taught the power that lurks in petty things. Great is the force of a few simple arrangements; for instance, the powers of a fence. On the prairie you wander a hundred miles and hardly find a stick or a stone. At rare intervals a thin oak-opening has been spared, and every such section has been long occupier}. But the farmer manages to procure wood from far, puts up a rail-fence, and at once the seeds sprout and the oaks rise. It was only browsing and fire which had kept them down.

Draw a pine fence about them, and for fifty years they mature ior the owner their delicate fruit. There is a great deal of enchantment in a chestnut rail or picketed pine boards. Nature suggests every economical expedient somewhert. on a great scale. Set out a pine-tree, and it dies in the first year, or lives a poor spindle. But Nature drops a pine-cone in Mariposa, and it lives fifteen centuries, grows three or four hundred feet high. and thirty in diameter-grows in a grove of giants, like a, colonnade of Thebes. Ask the tree how it was done. It did not grow on a ridge, but in a basin, where it found deep soil, cold enough and dry enough for the pine; defended itself from the sun by growing in groves, and from the wind by the walls of FARMING 755 the mountain. The roots that shot deepest, and the stems of happiest exposure, drew the nourishment from the rest, until the less thrifty perished and manured the soil for the stronger I and the mammoth Sequoias rose to their enormous proportions. The tra\\eller who saw them remembered his orchard at home, where every year, in the destroying wind, his forlorn trees pined like suffering virtue. In September, when the pears hang heaviest and are taking from the sun their gay colors, comes usually a gusty day which shakes the whole garden and throws down the heaviest fruit in bruised heaps. The planter took the hint of the Sequoias, built a high wall, or-better-surrounded the orchard with a nursery of birches and evergreens.

Thus he had the moun- tain basin in miniature; and his pears grew to the size of melons, and the vines beneath them ran an eighth of a mile. But this shelter creates a new climate. The wall that keeps off the strong wind keeps off the cold wind. The high wall reflecting the heat back on the soil gives that acre a quadruple share of sunshine-.

The chemist comes to his aid every year by following out some new hint drawn from Nature, and now affirms that this dreary space occupied by the farmer is needless; he will concentrate his kitchen-garden into a box of one or two rods square, will take the roots into his laboratory; the vines and stalks and stems may go sprawling about in the fields outside, he will attend to the roots in his tub, gorge them with food that is good for them .. The smaller his garden, the better he can feed it, and the larger the crop. As he nursed his Thanksgiving turkeys on bread and milk, so he will pamper his peaches and grapes on the viands they like best.

They keep the secret well, and never tell on your table whence they drew their sunset complexion or their delicate flavors. See what the farmer accomplishes by a cart-load of tiles: he FARMING alters the climate by letting off water which kept the land cold through constant evaporation, and allows the warm rain to bring down into the roots the temperature of the air and of the surface soil; and he deepens the soil, since the discharge of this standing water allows the roots of his plants to penetrate below the surface to the subsoil, and accelerates the ripening of the crop. The town of Concord is one of the oldest towns in this country, far on now in its third century. The selectmen have once in every five years perambulated the boundaries, and yet, in this very year, a large quantity of land has been discovered and added to the town without a murmur of complaint from any quarter. By drainage we went down to a subsoil we did not know, and have found there is a Concord under old Concord, which we are now getting the best crops from; a Middlesex under Middlesex; and, in fine, that Massachusetts has a basement story more valuable and that promises to pay a better rent than all the superstructure. But these tiles have acquired by association a new interest. These tiles are political economists, confuters of Malthus and Ricardo; they are so many Young Americans announcing a better era- more bread.

There has been a nightmare bred in England of indigestion and spleen among landlords and loom-lords, namely, the dogma that men breed too fast for the powers of the soil; that men multiply in a geometrical ratio, whilst corn multiplies only in an arith ... metical; and hence that, the more prosperous we are, the faster we approach these frightful limits nay, the plight of every new generation is worse than of the foregoing, because the first comers take up the best lands; the next, the second best; and each sue .. t:eeding wave of population is driven to poorer, so that the land !s ever yielding less returns to enlarging hosts of eaters. Henry Ca,rey of Philadelphia replied: \"Not so, :LVIr. Malthus, but just the opposite of so is the fact.\" The first planter, the savage, without helpers, without tools, looking chiefly to safety from his enemy-man or beast-takes FARMING iS7 poor land. The better lands are loaded with timber, which he cannot clear; they need drainage, which he cannot attempt. He cannot plough, or fell trees, or drain the rich swamp. He is a poor creature; he scratches with a sharp stick, lives in a cave or a butch, has no road but the trail of the moose or bear; he lives on their flesh when he can kill one, on roots and fruits when he", "or drain the rich swamp. He is a poor creature; he scratches with a sharp stick, lives in a cave or a butch, has no road but the trail of the moose or bear; he lives on their flesh when he can kill one, on roots and fruits when he cannot. He falls, and is lame; he coughs, he has a stitch in his side, he has a fever and chills; when he is hungry, he cannot always kill and eat a bear-chances of war-sometimes the bear eats him. 'T is long before he digs or plants at all, and then only\u00b7 a patch. Later he learns that his planting is better than hunting; that the earth works faster for him than he can work. for him .. self-works for him when he is asleep, when it rains, when heat overcomes him. The sunstroke which knocks him down brings his corn up. As his family thrive, and other planters come up around him, he begins to fell trees and clear good land; and when, by and by, there is more skill, and tools and roads, thf~ new generations are strong enough to open the lowlands, where the wash of mountains has accumulated the best soil, which yield a hundred-fold the former crops. The last lands are the best lands. It needs science and great numbers to cultivate the best lands, and in the best manner. Thus true political economy is not mean, but liberal, and on the pattern of the sun and sky. Population increases in the ratio of morality; credit exists in the ratio of morality .. Meantime we cannot enumerate the incidents and agents of the farm without reverting to their influence on the farmer. He carries out this cunlulative preparation of means to their last effect.

Meantime we cannot enumerate the incidents and agents of the farm without reverting to their influence on the farmer. He carries out this cunlulative preparation of means to their last effect. This crust of soil which ages have refined he refines again for the feeding of a civil and instructed people. The great ele- ments with which he deals cannot leave him unaffected, or unconscious of his ministry; but their influence somewhat ret sembles that which the same Nature has on the child-of sub- duing and silencing him. We see the farmer with pleasure and respect when we think what powers and utilities are so meekly worn. He knows every secret of labor; he changes the face of the landscape. Put him on a new planet and he would know where 758 FARMING to begin; yet there is no arrogance in his bearing, but a perfect gentleness. The farmer stands well on the world. Plain in man- ners as in dress, he would not shine in palaces; he is absolutely unknown and inadmissible therein; living or dying, he never shaI1 be heard of in them; yet the drawing-room heroes put down beside him would shrivel in his presence; he solid and unex- pressive, they expressed to gold-leaf. But he stands well on the world-as Adam did, as an Indian does, as Homer's heroes, Agamemnon or Achilles, do. He is a person whom a poet of any . clime-Milton, Firdusi, or Cervantes-would appreciate as being really a piece of the old Nature, comparable to sun and mOOD, rainbow and flood; because he is, as all natural persons are, representative of Nature as much as these.

That uncorrupted behavior which we admire in animals and in young children belongs to him, to the hunter, the sailor- the man who lives in the presence of Nature. Cities force growth and make men talkative and entertaining, but they make them artificial. What possesses interest for us is the naturel of ~ach, his constitutional excellence. This is forever a surprise, engaging and lovely; we cannot be satiated with knowing it, and about it; and it is this which the conversation with Nature cherishes and guards.

I'm going home. I aln going to my own hearth-stone, Bosomed in yon green hills alone-- A secret nook in a pleasant land, Whose groves the frolic fairies planned; Where arches green, the livelong day, Echo the blackbird's roundelay, And vulgar feet have never trod A spot that is sacred to thought and God. 0, when I am safe in my sylvan home, I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome; And when I am stretched beneath the pines~ Where the evening star so holy shines, I laugh at the lore and the pride of man, At the sophist schools and the learned clan; For what are they all, in their high conceit, When man in the bush with God may meet? 761 THE PROBLEM I LIKE a church; I like a cowl; I love a prophet of the soul; And on my heart monastic aisles Fall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles; Yet not for all his faith can see Would I that cowled churchman be.

Know'st thou what wove yon woodbird's nest Of leaves, and feathers from her breast? Or how the fish outbuilt her shell, Painting with morn each annual cell? Or how the sacred pine-tree adds To her old leaves new myriads? Such and so grew these holy piles, Whilst love and terror laid the tiles. THE PROBLEM: Earth proudly wears the Parthenon, As the best gem upon her zone, And Morning opes with haste her lids To gaze upon the Pyramids; O'er England's abbeys bends the sky, As on its friends, with kindred eye; For out of Thought's interior sphere These wonders rose to upper air; And Nature gladly gave them place, Adopted them into her race, And granted them an equal date With Andes and with Ararat. These temples grew as grows the grass; Art might obey, but not surpass. The passive Master lent his hand To the vast soul that o'er him planned; And the same power that reared the shrine Bestrode the tribes that knelt within.

The word unto the prophet spoken Was writ on tables yet unbroken; The word by seers or sibyls told, In groves of oak, or fanes of gold, Still floats upon the morning wind, S till whispers to the willing mind. One accent of the Holy Ghost The heedless world hath never lost. I know what say the fathers wise- The Book itself before me lies, Old Chrysostom, best Augustine, And he who blent both in his line, The younger Golden Lips or mines, Taylor, the Shakspeare of divines. URIEL His words are music in my ear, I see his cowled portrait dear; And yet, for all his faith could see, I would not the good bishop be. URIEL IT fell in the ancient periods Which the brooding soul surveys, Or ever the wild Time coined itself Into calendar months and days. This was the lapse of Uriel, Which in Paradise befell. Once, among the Pleiads walking, Seyd overheard the young gods talking; And the treason, too long pent, To his ears was evident. The young deities discussed Laws of form, and metre just, Orb, quintessence, and sunbeams, What 5ubsisteth, and what seems. One, with low tones that decide, And doubt and reverend use defied, With a look that solved the sphere, And stirred the devils everywhere, Gave his sentiment divine Against the being of aline. 'Line in nature is not found; Unit and universe are round; In vain produced, all rays return; Evil will bless, and ice will burn.' As UrieI spoke with piercing eye, A shudder ran around the sky; The stem old war-gods shook their heads, The seraphs frowned from myrtle-beds; - THE RHODORA Seemed", "nature is not found; Unit and universe are round; In vain produced, all rays return; Evil will bless, and ice will burn.' As UrieI spoke with piercing eye, A shudder ran around the sky; The stem old war-gods shook their heads, The seraphs frowned from myrtle-beds; - THE RHODORA Seemed to the holy festival The rash word boded ill to all; The balance-beam of Fate was bent; The bounds of good and ill were rent; Strong Hades could not keep his own, But all slid to confusion. A sad self-knowledge, withering, fell On the beauty of Uriel; In heaven once eminent, the god Withdrew, that hour, into his cloud; Whether doolned to long gyration In the sea of generation, Or by knowledge grown too bright To hit the nerve of feebler sight. Straightway, a forgetting wind S tole over the celestial kind, And their lips the secret kept, If in ashes the fire-seed slept. But now and then, truth-speaking things Shamed the angels' veiling wings; And, shrilling from the solar course, Or from fruit of chemic force, Procession of a soul in matter, Or the speeding change of water, Or out of the good of evil born, Came U riel's voice of cherub scorn, And a blush tinged the upper sky, And the gods shook, they knew not why.

The foe long since in silence slept; Alike the conqueror silent sleeps; And Time the ruined bridge has swept Down the dark stream which seaward creeps. On this green bank, by this soft stream, We set to-day a votive stone; That memory may their deed redeem, When, like our sires, our sons are gone.

Such tidings of the starry sphere Can this elastic air convey. Or haply 't was the cannonade Of the pent and darkened lake, Cooled by the pendent mountain's shade, Whose deeps, till beams of noonday break, Afflicted moan, and latest hold Even into May the iceberg cold.

MAY-DAY When late I walked, in earlier days, All was stiff and stark; Knee-deep snows choked all the ways, In the sky no spark; Firm-braced I sought my ancient woods, Struggling through the drifted roads; The whited desert knew me not, Snow-ridges masked each darling spot; The summer dells, by genius haunted, One arctic moon had disenchanted.

But soft! a sultry morning breaks; The ground-pines wash their rusty green, The maple-tops their crimson tint, On the soft path each track is seen, The girl's foot leaves its neater print. The pebble loosened from the frost Asks of the urchin to be tost. In flint and marble beats a heart, The kind Earth takes her children's part, The green lane is the school-boy's friend, Low leaves his quarrel apprehend, The fresh ground loves his top and ball, The air rings jocund to his call, MAY-DAY The brimming brook invites a leap, He dives the hollow, climbs the steep.

They were Night and Day, and Day and Night, Pilgrims wight with step forthright. I saw the Days deformed and low, Short and bent by cold and snow; MAY-DAY The merry Spring threw wreaths on them, Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell; Many a flower and many a gem, They were refreshed by the smell, They shook the snow from hats and shoon, They put their April raiment on; And those eternal forms, Unhurt by a thousand storms, Shot up to the height of the sky again, And danced as merrily as young men. I saw them mask their awful glance Sidewise meek in gossamer lids; And to speak my thought if none forbids It was as if the eternal gods 7 Tired of their starry periods, Hid their majesty in cloth Woven of tulips and painted moth. On carpets green the maskers march Below May's well-appointed arch. Each star, each god, each grace amain, Every joy and virtue speed, Marching duly in her train, And fainting Nature at her need Is made whole again.

THE ADIRONDACS A JOURNAL DEDICATED TO MY FELLOW TRAVELLERS IN AUGUST, 1858 Wise and polite,-and if I drew Their several portraits, you would own Chaucer had no such worthy crew\" Nor Boccace in Decameron. WE crossed Champlain to I(eeseville with our friends, Thence, in strong country carts, rode up the forks Of the Ausable stream, intent to reach The Adirondac lakes. At Martin's Beach We chose our boats; each man a boat and guide- Ten men, ten guides, our company all told. Next morn, we swept with oars the Saranac, With skies of benediction, to Round Lake, Where all the sacred mountains drew around us, Tahawus, Seaward, MacIntyre, Baldhead, And other Titans without muse or name. Pleased with these grand companions, we glide on, Instead of flowers, crowned with a wreath of hills. We made our distance wider, boat from boat, As each would hear the oracle alone. By the bright morn the gay flotilla slid Through files of flags that gleamed like bayonets, Through gold .. math-haunted beds of pickerel flower, Through scented banks of lilies white and gold, Where the deer feeds at night, the teal by day, On through the Upper Saranac, and up Pere Raquette strealn, to a. small tortuous pass 'Vinding through grassy shallows in and out, Two creeping miles of rushes,", "math-haunted beds of pickerel flower, Through scented banks of lilies white and gold, Where the deer feeds at night, the teal by day, On through the Upper Saranac, and up Pere Raquette strealn, to a. small tortuous pass 'Vinding through grassy shallows in and out, Two creeping miles of rushes, pads and sponge, To Follansbee Water and the Lake of Loons. Northward the length of Follansbee we rowed, Under low mountains, whose unbroken ridge 799 800 THE ADIRONDACS Ponderous with beechen forest sloped the shore. A pause and council: then, where near the head Due east a bay makes inward to the land Between two rocky arms, we climb the bank, And in the twilight of the forest noon Wield the first axe these echoes ever heard. We cut young trees to make our poles and thwarts, Barked the white spruce to weather fend the roof, Then struck a light aDd kindled the camp-fire. The wood was sovran with centennial trees- Oak, cedar, maple, poplar, beech and fir, Linden and spruce. In strict society Three conifers, white, pitch and Norway pine, Five-leaved, three ... leaved and two-leaved, grew thereby, Our patron pine was fifteen feet in girth, The maple eight, beneath its shapely tower. 'Welcome 1 ' the wood ... god murmured through the leaves, 'Welcome, though late, unknowing, yet known to me.' ~vening drew on; stars peeped through maple-boughs, Which o'erhung, like a cloud, our camping fire. Decayed millennial trunks, like moonlight flecks, Lit with phosphoric crumbs the forest floor.

So fast will Nature acclimate her sons, Though late returning to her pristine ways. Off soundings, seamen do not suffer cold; And, in the forest, delicate clerks, unbrowned, Sleep on the fragrant brush, as on down-beds. Up with the dawn, they fancied the light air That circled freshly in their forest dress Made them to boys again. Happier that they THE ADIRONDACS Slipped off their pack of duties, leagues behind, At the first mounting of the giant stairs. No placard on these rocks warned to the polls, No door-bell heralded a visitor, No courier waits, no letter came or went, Nothing was ploughed, or reaped, or bought, or sold; The frost might glitter, it would blight no crop, The falling rairt will spoil no holiday. We were made freemen of the forest laws, All dressed, like Nature, fit for ber own ends, Essaying nothing she cannot perform. In Adirondac lakes, At morn or noon, the guide rows bareheaded: Shoes, flannel shirt, and kersey trousers make His brief toilette: at night, or in the rain, He dons a surcoat which he doffs at morn: A paddle in the right hand, or an oar, And in the left, a gun, his needful arms ..

Two Doctors in the camp Dissected the slain deer, weighed the trout's brain, Captured the lizard, salamander, shrew, Crab, mice, snail, dragon-fly, minnovv and moth; Insatiate skill in water or in air Waved the scoop-net, and nothing came amiss; The while, one leaden pot of alcohol Gave an impartial tomb to all the kinds.

S.), at Woodstock, Connecticut. He was the fifth of the nineteen children of N oab and Lydia (Kent) Ripley. Seventeen of these nineteen chil- dren married, and it is stated that the mother died leaving nine- teen children, one hundred and two grandchildren and ninety-six great-grandchildren. The father was born at Hingham, on the farm purchased by his ancestor, William Ripley, of England, at the first settlement of the town; which farm has been occupied by seven or eight generations. Ezra Ripley followed the busi- ness of farming till sixteen years of age, when nis father wished him to be qualified to teach a grammar school, not thinking himself able to send one son to college without injury to his other children. With this view, the father agreed with the late Rev. Dr. Forbes of Gloucester, then minister of North Brook- field, to fit Ezra for college by the time he should be twenty-one", "grammar school, not thinking himself able to send one son to college without injury to his other children. With this view, the father agreed with the late Rev. Dr. Forbes of Gloucester, then minister of North Brook- field, to fit Ezra for college by the time he should be twenty-one years of age, and to have him labor during the time sufficiently to pay for his instruction, clothing and books. But, when fitted for college, the son could not be contented with teaching, which he had tried the preceding winter. He had early manifested a desire for learning, and could not be satisfied without a public education. Always inclined to notice ministers, and frequently attempting, when only five or six years old, to imitate them by preaching, now that he had become a professor of religion he had an ardent desire to be a preacher of the gospel. He had to encounter great difficulties, but, through a kind providence and the patronage of Dr. Forbes, he entered Harvard University, July, 1772. The commencement of the Revolutionary War greatly interrupted his education at college. In 1775, in his senior year, the college was removed from Cam- bridge to this town. The studies were much broken up. Many of the students entered the army, and the class never returned BI9 \u2022 820 EZRA RIPLEY, D.D. to Cambridge. There were an unusually large number of dh;. tinguished men in this class of 1776: Christopher Gore, Gov .. ernor of Massachusetts and Senator in Congress; Samuel Sewall, Chief Justice of Massachusetts; George Thacher , Judge of the Supreme Court; Royall Tyler, Chief Justice of Vermont; and the late learned Dr. Prince, of Salem. Mr. Ripley was ordained minister of Concord November 7, 1778.

Mr. Ripley was ordained minister of Concord November 7, 1778. He married, November 16, 1780, Mrs. Phebe (Bliss) Emerson, then a widow of thirty .. nine, with five children. They had three children: Sarah, born August 18, 1781; Samuel, born May II, 1783; Daniel Bliss, born August I, 1784. He died September 2 1, 184 I. To these facts, gathered chiefly from his own diary, and stated nearly in his own words, I can only add a few traits from memory. He was identified with the ideas and forms of the New England Church, which expired about the same time with him, so that he and his coevals seemed the rear guard of the great camp and army of the Puritans, which, however in its last days declining into formalism, in the heyday of its strength had planted and liberated America. It was a pity that his old meet- ing-house should have been modernized in his time. I am sure all who remember both will associate his form with whatever was grave and droll in the old, cold, unpainted, uncarpeted, square-pewed meeting-house, with its four iron-gray deacons in their little box under the pUlpit-with Watts's hymns, witn long prayers, rich with the diction of ages; and not less with the report like musketry from the movable seats. He and his contemporaries, the old New England clergy, were believers in what is called a particular providence-certainly, as they held it, a very particular providence-following the narrowness of King David and the Jews, who thought the universe existed only or mainly for their church and congregation. Perhaps I cannot better illustrate this tendency", "the old New England clergy, were believers in what is called a particular providence-certainly, as they held it, a very particular providence-following the narrowness of King David and the Jews, who thought the universe existed only or mainly for their church and congregation. Perhaps I cannot better illustrate this tendency than by citing a record from the diary of the father of his predecessor 7 the minister of Malden, written in the blank leaves of the almanac for the yeaf 1735. The minister writes against January 31St: \"Bought a shay for - EZRA RIPLEY, D.D . 82L .27 pounds, 10 shillings. The Lord grant it may be a comfort and blessing to my family.\" In March following he notes: \"Had a safe and comfortable journey to York.\" But April 24th, we- find: \"Shay overturned, with my wife and I in it, yet neither of us much hurt.. Blessed be our gracious Preserver. Part of the shay, as it lay upon one side, went over my wife, and yet she was scarcely anything hurt. How wonderful the preserva ... tion.\" Then again, May 5th: \"Went to the beach with three of the children. The beast, being frightened when we were all out of the shay, overturned and broke it. I desire (I hope I desire it) that the Lord would teach me suitably to resent this Providence, to make suitable remarks on it, and to be suitably affected with it. Have I done well to get me a shay? Have I not been proud or too fond of this convenience? Do I exercise the faith in the Divine care and protection which I ought to do? Should I not be more in my study and less fond of diversion? Do I not withhold more than is meet from pious and charitable", "not been proud or too fond of this convenience? Do I exercise the faith in the Divine care and protection which I ought to do? Should I not be more in my study and less fond of diversion? Do I not withhold more than is meet from pious and charitable uses?\" Well, on 15th May we have this: \"Shay brought home; mending cost thirty shillings. Favored in this respect beyond expectation.\" I6th May: \"My wife and I rC'de together to Rumney Marsh. The beast frighted several times.\" And at last we have this record, June 4th: \"Disposed of my shay to Rev .. Mr. White.\" The same faith made what was !trong and what was weak. in Dr. Ripley and his associates. He was a perfectly sincere man, punctual, severe, but just and charitable, and if he made his forms a strait-jacket to others, he wore the same himself all his years. Trained in this church, and very well qualified by his natural talent to work in it, it was never out of his mind. He looked at every person and thing from the parochial point of view. I remember, when a boy, driving about Concord with him, and in passing each house he told the story of the faJ.nily that lived in it, and especially he gave me anecdotes of the nine church members who had made a division in the church in the time of his predecessor, and showed me how everyone of the nine had come to bad fortune or to a bad end. His pray- ers for rain and against the lightning, \"that it may 11.0t lick. up 822 EZRA RIPLEY, D.D. our spirits;\" and for good weather; and against sickness and insanity; \"that we have not been tossed to and fro until the dawning of", "bad fortune or to a bad end. His pray- ers for rain and against the lightning, \"that it may 11.0t lick. up 822 EZRA RIPLEY, D.D. our spirits;\" and for good weather; and against sickness and insanity; \"that we have not been tossed to and fro until the dawning of the day; that we have not been a terror to ourselves and others\"-are well remembered, and his own entire faith that these petitions were not to be overlooked, and were en- titled to a favorable answer. Some of those around me will remember one occasion of severe drought in this vicinity, when the late Rev. Mr. Goodwin offered to relieve the Doctor of the duty of leading in prayer; but the Doctor suddenly remem- bering the season, rejected his offer with some humor, as with an air that said to all the congregation, \"This is no time for you young Cambridge men; the affair, sir, is getting serious. I will pray myself.\" One August afternoon, when I was in his hayfield helping him with his man to rake up his hay, I well remember his pleading, almost reproachful looks at the sky, when the thunder-gust was coming up to spoil his hay. He raked very fast, then looked at the cloud, and said, \"We are in the Lord's hand;\" and seemed to say, \"You know me; this field is mine-Dr. Ripley's-thine own servantl\" He used to tell the story of one of his old friends, the min- ister of Sudbury, who, being at the Thursday lecture in Boston, heard the officiating clergyman praying for rain.

He mentioned to me on the way his fears that the oldest son, who was now to succeed to the farm, was becoming intemperate. We presently arrived, and the Doctor addressed each of the mourners separately: 'lSir, I condole with you.\" \"Madam, I condole with you .. \" \"Sir, I knew your great-grandfather ..

I can remember a little speech he made to me, when the last tie of blood which held me and my brothers to his house was broken by the death of his daughter.

I regret very much the causes (which you know very well) which make it impossible for me to ask you to stay and break bread with us.\" With the Doctor's views it was a matter of religion to say thus much. He had 8. reverence and love of society, and the patient, continuiIlg courtesy; carrying out every respectfui at- tention to the end, which marks what is called the manners of the old schooL His hospitality obeyed Charles Lamb's rule, and \"ran fine to the last.\" His partiality for ladies was always strong, and was by no means abated by time. He claimed privi ... lege of years, was much addicted to kissing; spared neither maid, wife nor widow, and, as a lady thus favored remarked to me, \"seemed as if he was going to make a meal of you.\" He was very credulous, and as he was no reader of books or journals, he knew nothing beyond the columns of his weekly reli- gious newspaper, the tracts of his sect, and perhaps the Middlesex Yeoman. He was the easy dupe of any tonguey agent, whether colonizationist or anti-papist, or charlatan of iron combs, or", "as he was no reader of books or journals, he knew nothing beyond the columns of his weekly reli- gious newspaper, the tracts of his sect, and perhaps the Middlesex Yeoman.

Downing's letters were in every paper, he re- peated to me at table some of the particulars of that gentleman's intimacy with General Jackson, in a manner that betrayed to me at once that he took the whole for fact. To undeceive bim, I hastened to recall some particulars to show the absurdity of EZRA RIPLEY, D.D. the thing, as the Major and the President going out skating on the Potomac, etc. \"Why,\" said the Doctor with perfect faith, \"it was a bright moonlight night;\" and I am not sure that he did not die in the belief in the reality of Major Downing. Like other credulous men, he was opinionative, and, as I well re .. member, a great browbeater of the poor old fathers who still survived from the 19th of April, to the end that they should testify to his history as he had written it. He was a man so kind and sympathetic, his character was so transparent, and his merits so intelligible to all observers, that he was very justly appreciated in this community. He was a natural gentleman, no dandy, but courtly, hospitable, manly and public--spirited; his nature social, his house open to all men. We remember the remark made by the old farmer who used to travel hither from Maine, that no horse from the Eastern coun .. try would go by the Doctor's gate.

We remember the remark made by the old farmer who used to travel hither from Maine, that no horse from the Eastern coun .. try would go by the Doctor's gate. Travellers from the West and North and South bear the like testimony. His brow was serene and open to his visitor, for he loved men, and he had no studies, no occupations, which company could interrupt. His friends were his study, and to see them loosened his talents and his tongue. In his house dwelt order and prudence and plenty. There was no waste and no stint. He was open ... handed and just and generous. Ingratitude and meanness in his beneficiaries did not wear out his compassion; he bore the insult, and the next day his basket for the beggar, his horse and chaise for the cripple, were at their door. Though he knew the value of a dollar as well as another man, yet he loved to buy dearer and sell cheaper than others. He subscribed to all charities, and it is no reflection on others to say that he was the most public- spirited man in the town. The late Dr. Gardiner, in a funeral sermon on some parishioner whose virtues did not readily come to mind, honestly said, -'He was good at fires.\" Dr. Ripley had many virtues, and yet all will remember that even in his old age, if the firebell was rung, he was instantly on horseback with his buckets, and bag.

D. 82 ~ which make the distinction of the scholar, and which, under better discipline, might have ripened into a Bentley or a Porson. He had a foresight, when he opened his mouth, of all that he would say, and he marched straight to the conclusion. In debate, in the vestry of the Lyceum, the structure of his sentences was admirable; so neat, so natural, so terse, his words fell like stones; and often, though quite unconscious of it, his speech was a satire on the loose, voluminous, draggle-tail periods of other speakers. He sat down when he had done. A man of anecdote, his talk in the parlor was chiefly narrative. We remember the remark of a gentleman who listened with much delight to his conversation at the time when the Doctor was preparing to go to Baltimore and Washington, that \"a man who could tell a story so well was company for kings and John Quincy Adams.\" Sage and savage strove harder in him than in any of my acquaintances, each getting the mastery by turns, and pretty sudden turns: 'lSave us from the extremity of cold and these violent sudden changes.\" \"The society will meet after the Ly- ceum, as it is difficult to bring people together in the evening- and no moon.\" \"Mr. N.

He watched with interest the garden, the field, the orchard, the house and the barn, horse, cow, sheep and dog, and all the common objects that engage the thought of the farmer. He kept his eye on the horizon, and knew the weather like a sea- captain. The usual experiences of men, birth, marriage, sickness, death, burial; the common temptations; the common ambitions -he studied them all, and sympathized so well in these that he was excellent company and counsel to all, even the most humble and ignorant.

In all such passages he justified himself to the con- science, and commonly to the love, of the persons concerned. He was the more competent to these searching discourses from his knowledge of family history. He knew everybody's grand- father, and seemed to address each person rather as the repre- sentative of his house and name, than as an individual. In him have perished more local and personal anecdotes of this village and vicinity than are possessed by any survivor. This intimate knowledge of families, and this skill of speech, and still more, his sympathy, made him incomparable in his parochial visits, and in his exhortations and prayers. He gave himself up to his feelings, and said on the instant the best things in the world. Many and many a felicity he had in his prayer, now forever lost, which defied all the rules of all the rhetoricians. He did not know when he was good in prayer or sermon, for he had no literature and no art; but he believed, and therefore spoke.

ADDRESS EMANCIPATION IN THE BRITISH WEST INDmS FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS : We are met to exchallge con- gratulations on the anniversary of an event singular in the his- tory of civilization; a day of reason; of the clear light; of that which makes us better than a flock of birds and beasts; a day which gave the immense fortification of a fact, of gross history, to ethical abstractions. It was the settlement, as far as a great Empire was concerned, of a question on which almost every lead- ing citizen in it had taken care to record his vote; one which for many years absorbed the attention of the best and most eminent of mankind. I might well hesitate, coming from other studies, and without the smallest claim to be a special laborer in this work of humanity, to undertake to set this matter before you; which ought rather to be done by a strict cooperation of many well- advised persons; but I shall not apologize for my weakness. In this cause, no man's weakness is any prejudice: it has a thousand sons; if one man cannot speak, ten others can; and, whether by the wisdom of its friends, or by the folly of the adversaries; by speech and by silence; by doing and by omitting to do, it goes forward. Therefore I will speak-or, not I, but the might of lib- erty in my weakness. The subject is said to have the property of making dull men eloquent. It has been in all men's experience a marked effect of the enter", "doing and by omitting to do, it goes forward. Therefore I will speak-or, not I, but the might of lib- erty in my weakness. The subject is said to have the property of making dull men eloquent. It has been in all men's experience a marked effect of the enter ... prise in behalf of the African, to generate an overbearing and defying spirit. The institution of slavery seems to its opponent t(.l have but one side, and he feels that none but a stupid or a ma- lignant person can hesitate on a view of the facts. Under such an impulse, I was about to say, If any cannot speak, or cannot hear the words of freedom, let him go hence-I had almost said, Creep into your grave, the universe has no need of you! But I hav6; thought better: let him not go. When we consider what remam, 83I , I\u00b7 832 E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S to be done for this interest in this country, the dictates of human- ity make us tender of such as are not yet persuaded. The hardest selfishness is to be borne with. Let us withhold every reproachful, and, if we can, every indignant remark. In this cause, we must renounce our temper, and the risings of pride. If there be any man who thinks the ruin of a race of men a small matter, com- pared with the last decoration and completions of his own com- fort-who would not so much as part with his ice-cream, to save them from rapine and manacles, I think I must not hesitate to satisfy that man that also his cream and vanilla are safer and cheaper by placing the negro nation on a fair footing", "of his own com- fort-who would not so much as part with his ice-cream, to save them from rapine and manacles, I think I must not hesitate to satisfy that man that also his cream and vanilla are safer and cheaper by placing the negro nation on a fair footing than by robbing them. If the Virginian piques himself on the picturesque luxury of his vassalage, on the heavy Ethiopian manners of his house-servants, their silent obedience, their hue of bronze, their turbaned heads, and would not exchange them for the more intel- ligent but precarious hired service of whites, I shall not refuse to show him that when their free-papers are made Qut, it will still be their interest to remain on his estate, and that the oldest plant- ers of Jamaica are convinced that it is cheaper to pay wages than to own the slave. The history of mankind interests us only as it exhibits a steady gain of truth and right, in the incessant conflict which it records between the material and the moral nature. From the earliest monuments it appears that one race was victim and served the other races. In the oldest temples of Egypt, negro captives are painted on the tombs of kings, in such attitudes as to show that they are on the point of being executed; and Herodotus, our oldest historian, relates that the Troglodytes hunted the Ethi- opians in four-horse chariots. From the earliest time, the negro has been an article of luxury to the commercial nations. So has it been, down to the day that has just dawned on the world. Lan- guage must be raked, the secrets of slaughter-houses and infa- mous holes that cannot front the day, must be ransacked, to tell what negro slavery has been.

Lan- guage must be raked, the secrets of slaughter-houses and infa- mous holes that cannot front the day, must be ransacked, to tell what negro slavery has been. These men, our benefactors, as they are producers of com and wine, of coffee, of tobacco, of cotton, of sugar, of rum and brandy; gentle and joyous themselves, and producers of comfort and luxury for the civilized world-there E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE :s OJj seated in the finest climates of the globe, children of the sun- I am heart-sick when I read how they came there, and how they are kept there. Their case was left out of the mind and out of the heart of their brothers. The prizes of society, the trumpet of fame, the privileges of learning, of culture, of religion, the de- cencies and joys of marriage, honor, obedience, personal author\", ity and a perpetual melioration into a finer civility-these were for all, but not for them. For the negro, was the slave-ship to begin with, in whose filthy hold he sat in irons, unable to lie down; bad food, and insufficiency of that; disfranchisement; no property in the rags that covered him; no marriage, no right in the poor black woman that cherished him in her bosom, no right to the children of his body; no security from the humors, none from the crimes, none from the appeti tes of his master: toil, famine, insult and flogging; and, when he sank in the furrow, no wind of good fame blew over him, no priest of salvation visited him with glad tidings: but he went down to death", "from the humors, none from the crimes, none from the appeti tes of his master: toil, famine, insult and flogging; and, when he sank in the furrow, no wind of good fame blew over him, no priest of salvation visited him with glad tidings: but he went down to death with dusky dreams of African shadow-catchers and Obeahs hunting him. Very sad was the negro tradition, that the Great Spirit, in the beginning offered the black man, whom he loved better than the buckra, or white, hi~ choice of two boxes, a big and a little one. The blacl{ man was greedy, and chose the largest. \"The buckra box was full up with pen, paper and whip, and the negro box with hoe and bill; and hoe and bill for negro to this day.\" But the crude element of good in human affairs must work and ripen, spite of whips and plantation laws and West Indian interest. Conscience rolled on its pillow, and could not sleep. We sympathize very tenderly here with the poor aggrieved planter, of whom so many unpleasant things are said; but if we saw the whip applied to old men, to tender women; and, undeniably, though I shrink to say so, pregnant women set in the treadmill for refusing to work; when, not they, but the eternal law of ani- mal nature refused to work; if we saw men's backs flayed with cowhides, and \"hot rum poured on, superinduced with brine or pickle, rubbed in with a cornhusk, in the scorching heat 01 the sun;\" if we saw the runaways hunted with bloodhounds into swamps and hills; and, in cases of passion, a planter throwint 834 E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S his negro into a copper of", "a cornhusk, in the scorching heat 01 the sun;\" if we saw the runaways hunted with bloodhounds into swamps and hills; and, in cases of passion, a planter throwint 834 E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S his negro into a copper of boiling cane-juice-if we saw these things with eyes, we too should wince. They are not pleasant sights. The blood is moral: the blood is anti-slavery: it runs cold in the veins: the stomach rises with disgust, and curses slavery. Well, so it happened; a good man or woman, a country boy or girl, it would so fall out, once in a while saw these injuries and had the indiscretion to tell of them. The horrid story ran and flew; the winds blew it all over the world. They who heard it asked their rich and great friends if it was true, or only mission- ary lies. The richest and greatest, the prime minister of England, the king's privy council were obliged to say that it was too true. It became plain to all men, the more this business was looked into, that the crimes and cruelties of the slave-traders and slave- owners could not be overstated. The more it was searched, the more shocking anecdotes came up-things not to be spoken. Hu- mane persons who were informed of the reports insisted on prov- ing them. Granville Sharpe was accidentally made acquainted\u00b7 with the sufferings of a slave, whom a West Indian planter had brought with him to London and had beaten with a pistol on his head, so badly that his whole body became diseased, and the man useless to his master, who left him to go whither he pleased.

The man applied to Mr. William Sharpe, a charitable surgeon, who attended the diseases of the poor. In process of time, he was healed. Granville Sharpe found him at his brother's and pro- cured a place for him in an apothecary's shop. The master acci- dentally met his recovered slave, and instantly endeavored to get possession of him. Sharpe protected the slave. In consulting with the lawyers, they told Sharpe the laws were against him. Sharpe would not believe it; no prescription on earth could ever render such iniquities legal. 'But the decisions are against you, and Lord Mansfield, now Chief Justice of England, leans to the decisiuns .. ' Sharpe instantly sat down and gave himself to the study of English law for more than two years, until he had proved that the opinions relied on, of Talbot and Yorke, were incom- patible with the former English decisions and with the whole ~pirit of English law. He published his book in 1769, and he so tilled the heads and hearts of his advocates that when he brought EM AN C I PAT ION IN WE S TIN DIE S 835 the case of George Somerset, another slave, before Lord Mans .. field, the slavish decisions were set aside, and equity affirmed.

Very unwilling had that great lawyer been to reverse the late decisions; he suggested twice from the bench, in the course of the tritti, how the question might be got rid of: but the bint was not taken; the case was adjourned again and again, and jUdgment delayed. At last judgment was demanded, and on the 22d June, 1772, Lord Mansfield is re .. ported to have decided in these words: \"Immemorial usage preserves the memory of positive lawJ long after all traces of the occasion, reason, authority and time of its introduction, are lost; and in a case so odious as the condi- tion of slaves, must be taken strictly (tracing the subject to natural principles, the claim of slavery never can be supported). The power claimed by this return never was in use here. We can .. not say the cause set forth by this return is allowed or approved by the laws of this kingdom; and therefore the man must be discharged.) , This decision established the principle that the \"air of Eng- land is too pure for any slave to breathe,\" but the wrongs in the islands were not thereby touched. Public attention, however, was drawn that way, and the methods of the stealing and the trans- portation from Africa became noised abroad. The Quakers got the story .. In their plain meeting-houses and prim dwellings this dismal agitation got entrance. They were rich: they owned, f01 debt or by inheritance, island property; they were religious, ten..- der-hearted men and women; and they had to hear the news and digest it as they could.

John Woolman of New Jersey, whilst yet an apprentice, was uneasy in his mind wheu. B36 EM AN C I PAT ION IN WE S TIN DIE S he was set to write a bill of sale of a negro, for his master. He gave his testimony against the traffic, in Maryland and Virginia. Thomas Clarkson was a youth at Cambridge, England, when the subject given out for a Latin prize dissertation was, \"Is it right to make slaves of others against their will?\" He wrote an essay, and won the prize; but se wrote too well for his own peace; he began to ask himself if these things could be true; and if they were, he could no longer rest. He left Cambridge; he fell in with the six Quakers. They engaged him to act for them. He himself interested Mr. Wilberforce in the matter. The shipmasters in that trade were the greatest miscreants, and guilty of every bar ... barity to their own crews.

The shipmasters in that trade were the greatest miscreants, and guilty of every bar ... barity to their own crews. Clarkson went to Bristol, made him .. self acquainted with the interior of the slave-ships and the de- tails of the trade. The facts confirmed his sentiment, \"that Providence had ne\\ler made that to be wise which was immoral, and that the slave-trade was as impolitic as it was unjust;\" that it was found peculiarly fatal to those employed in it. More sea- men died in that trade in one year than in the whole remaining trade of the country in two. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox were drawn into the generous enterprise. In I788, the House of Commons voted Parliamentary inquiry. In I 79 I, a bill to abolish the trade was brought in by Wilberforce, and supported by him and by Fox and Burke and Pitt, with the utmost ability and faithful- ness; resisted by the planters and the whole West Indian in- terest, and lost. During the next sixteen years, ten times, year after year, the attempt was renewed by Mr. Wilberforce, and ten times defeated by the planters. The king, and all the royal family but one, were against it. These debates are instructive, as they show on what grounds the trade was assailed and de- fended. Everything generous, wise and sprightly is sure to come to the attack. On the other part are found cold prudence, bare- faced selfishness and silent votes. But the nation was aroused to enthusiasm. Every horrid fact became known. In 1791, three hundred thousand persons in Britain pledged themselves to ab- stain from all articles of island produce. The planters were obliged to give way; and in I 807, on the 25th", "faced selfishness and silent votes. But the nation was aroused to enthusiasm. Every horrid fact became known.

EMANCIPATION IN WES1' INDIES 831 The assailants of slavery had early agreed to limit their po- litical action on this subject to the abolition of the trade, but Granville Sharpe, as a matter of conscience, whilst he acted as chairman of the London Committee, felt constrained to record his protest against the limitation, declaring that slavery was as much a crime against the Divine law as the slave .. trade. The trade, under false flags, went on as before. In 182 I, according to official documents presented to the American government by the Colonization Society, 200,000 slaves were deported from Africa. Nearly 30,000 were landed in the port of Havana alone. In con- sequence of the dangers of the trade growing out of the act of abolition, ships were built sharp for swiftness, and with a fright- ful disregard of the comfort of the victims they were destin~ to transport. They carried five, six, even seven hundred stowed in a ship built so narrow as to be unsafe, being made just broad enough on the beam to keep the sea. In attempting to make its escape from the pursuit of a man ... of-war, one ship flung five hun- dred slaves alive into the sea. These facts went into Parliament .. In the islands was an ominous state of cruel and licentious so- ciety; every house had a dungeon attached to it; every slave was worked by the Whip. There is", "man ... of-war, one ship flung five hun- dred slaves alive into the sea. These facts went into Parliament .. In the islands was an ominous state of cruel and licentious so- ciety; every house had a dungeon attached to it; every slave was worked by the Whip. There is no end to the tragic anecdotes in the municipal records of the colonies. The boy was set to strip and flog his own mother to blood; for a small offence. Looking in the face of his master by the negro was held to be violence by the island courts. He was worked sixteen hours, and his ration by law, in some islands, was a pint of flour and one salt her- ring a day. He suffered insult, stripes, mutilation at the humor of the master: iron collars were riveted on their necks with iron prongs ten inches long; capsicum pepper was rubbed in the eyes of the females; and they were done to death with the most shock- ing levity between the master and manager, without fine or in- quiry. And when, at last, some Quakers, Moravians, and Wes- leyan and Baptist missionaries, following in the steps of Carey and Ward in the East Indies, had been moved to come and cheer the poor victim with the hope of SOIl'l;e reparation, in a future world, of the wrongs he suffered in this, these missionaries were persecuted by the planters, their lives threatened, their chappb EMANCIPATION IN WEST INDIES burned, and the negroes furiously forbidden to go near them. These outrages rekindled the flame of British indignation. Peti- tions poured into Parliament: a million persons signed their names to these; and in 183-3, on the 14th May, Lord Stanley, Minister of the Colonies, introduced into the House of Commons his bill", "the negroes furiously forbidden to go near them.

Peti- tions poured into Parliament: a million persons signed their names to these; and in 183-3, on the 14th May, Lord Stanley, Minister of the Colonies, introduced into the House of Commons his bill for the Emancipation. The scheme of the Minister, with such modification as it re- ceived in the legislature, proposed gradual emancipation; that on lst August, 1834, all persons now slaves should be entitled to be registered as apprenticed laborers, and to acquire thereby all the rights and privileges of freemen, subject to the restriction of laboring under certain conditions. These conditions were, that the prredials should owe three fourths of the profits of their labor to their masters for six years, and the non ... prredials fo\" four years. The other fourth of the apprentice's tiIne was to be his own, which he might sell to his Inaster, or to other persons; and at the end of the term of years fixed, he should be free. With these provisions and conditions, the bill proceeds, in the twelfth section, in the following terms: \"Be it enacted, that all and every per~on who, on the first August, 1834, shall be holden in slavery within any such British colony as aforesaid, shall upon and from and after the said first August, become ar.ld be to all intents and purposes free, and discharged of and from all man- ner of slavery, and shall be absolutely and forever manumitted; and that the children thereafter born to any such persons, and the offspring of such children, shall, in like n1anner, be free, from their birth; and that from and after the first August, 1834, slavery shall be and is hereby utterly and forever abolished and declared", "absolutely and forever manumitted; and that the children thereafter born to any such persons, and the offspring of such children, shall, in like n1anner, be free, from their birth; and that from and after the first August, 1834, slavery shall be and is hereby utterly and forever abolished and declared unlawful throughout the British colonies, plantations, and possessions abroad.\" The Ministers, having estimated the slave products of the colonies in annual exports of sugar, rum and coffee, at \u00a3r ,500,000 per annum, estimated the total value of the slave property at 30,000,000 pounds sterling, and proposed to give the planters, as a compensation for so much of the slaves' time as the act took from them, 20,000,000 pounds sterling, to be divided into nine- teen shares for the nineteen colonies, ,and to be distributed to the E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S 839 owners of slaves by commissioners, whose appointment and du, ties were regulated by the Act. After much debate, the bill passed by large majorities. The apprenticeship system is understood to have proceeded from Lord Brougham, and was by him urged on his colleagues, who, it is said, were inclined to the policy of imme- diate emancipation_ The colonial legislatures received the act of Parlialnent with various degrees of displeasure, and, of course, every provision of the bill was criticised with severity_ The new relation betwee~ the master and the apprentice, it was feared, would be mischie\u00b7 vous; for the bill required the appointment of magistrates who should hear every complaint of the apprentice and see that jus .. tice was done him. It Vlas feared that the interest of the master and servant would now produce perpetual discord between them. In the island of Antigua, containing 37,000 people, 30,000", "bill required the appointment of magistrates who should hear every complaint of the apprentice and see that jus .. tice was done him. It Vlas feared that the interest of the master and servant would now produce perpetual discord between them. In the island of Antigua, containing 37,000 people, 30,000 being negroes, these objections had such weight that the legislature re- jected the apprenticeship system, and adopted absolute emanci- pation. In the other islands the system of the Ministry was ac .. cepted. The reception of it by the negro population was equal in nobleness to the deed. The negroes were called together by the missionaries and by the planters, and the news explained to them. On the night of the 31St July, they met everywhere at their churches and chapels, and at midnight, when the clock struck twelve, on their knees, the silent, weeping assembly became men; they rose and embraced each other; they cried, they sung, they prayed, they were wild with joy, but there was no riot, no feast~ ing. I have n~ver read anything in history more touching than the moderation of the negroes. Some American captains left the shore and put to sea, anticipating insurrection and general mur- der. With far different thoughts, the negroes spent the hour in their huts and chapels. I will not repeat to you the well-known paragraph, in which lVlessrs. Thome and Kimball, the commis- sioners sent out in the year 1837 by the American Anti-Slavery Society, describe the occurrences of that night in the island of Antigua.

The clergy and missionaries throughout the island were actively engaged, seizing the opportunity to enlighten the people on all the duties and responsibilities of their new relation, and urging them to the attainment of that higher liberty with which Christ maketh his children free. In every quarter, we were as- sured, the day was like a Sabbath. Work had ceased. The hum of business was still: tranquillity pervaded the towns and country. The planters informed us that they went to the chapels where their own people were assembled, greeted them, shook hands with them, and exchanged the most hearty good wishes. At Grace Hill, there were at least a thousand persons around the Moravian Chapel who could not get in. For once the house of God suffered violence, and the violent took it by force. At Grace Bay, the people, all dressed in white, formed a procession, and walked arm in arm into the chapel. We were told that the dress of the negroes on that occasion was uncommonly simple and modest. There was not the least disposition to gayety.

Throughout the island, there was not a single dance known of, either day or night.~ nOr so much as a fiddle played.\" , On the next Monday morning, with very few exceptions, every negro on every plantation was in the field at his work. In some places, they waited to see their master, to know what bargain he would make; but for the most part, throughout the.islands, noth- ing painful occurred. In June, 1835, the Ministers, Lord Aber- deen and Sir George Grey, declared to the Parliament that the system worked well; that now for ten months, from 1St August, 1834, no injury or violence had been offered to any white, and only one black had been hurt in 800,000 negroes: and, contrary to many sinister predictions, that the new crop of island produce would not fall short of that of the last year. But the habit of oppression was not destroyed by a law and a nay of jubilee. It soon appeared in all the islands that the planters EM A N C 1 PAT ION IN WE S TIN DIE S 84I were disposed to use their old privileges, and overwork the ap- prentices; to take from them, under various pretences, their fourth part of their time; and to exert the same licentious des- potism as before. The negroes complained to the magistrates and to the governor. In the island of Jamaica, this ill blood continu- .. ally grew worse. The governors, Lord Belmore, the Earl of Sligo, and afterwards Sir Lionel Smith (a governor of their own class, who had been sent out to", "as before. The negroes complained to the magistrates and to the governor. In the island of Jamaica, this ill blood continu- .. ally grew worse. The governors, Lord Belmore, the Earl of Sligo, and afterwards Sir Lionel Smith (a governor of their own class, who had been sent out to gratify the planters) , threw themselves on the side of the oppressed, and were at constant quarrel with the angry and bilious island legislature. Nothing can exceed the ill humor and sulkiness of the addresses of this assembly. I may here express a general remark, which the history of .5!avery seems to justify, that it is not founded solely on the avarice of the planter. We sometimes say, the planter does not want slaves, he only wants the immunities and the luxuries which the slaves yield him; give him money, give him a machine that will yield him as much money as the slaves, and he will thankfully let them go. He has no love of slavery, he wants 1ux-- ury, and he will pay even this price of crime and danger for it. But I think experience does not warrant this favorable distinc- tion, but shows the existence, beside the covetousness, of a bitter element, the love of power, the voluptuousness of bolding a hu~ man being in his absolute control. We sometimes observe that spoiled children contract a habit of annoying quite wantonly those who have charge of them, and seem to measure their own sense of well-being, not by what they do, but by the degree of. reaction they can cause. It is vain to get rid of them by not mind- ing them: if purring and humming is not noticed, they squeal and screech; then if you chide and console them, they find the experiment succeeds,", "not by what they do, but by the degree of. reaction they can cause. It is vain to get rid of them by not mind- ing them: if purring and humming is not noticed, they squeal and screech; then if you chide and console them, they find the experiment succeeds, and they begin again. The child will sit in your arms contented, provided you do nothing. If you take a book and read, he commences hostile operations. The planter is the spoiled child of his unnatural habits, and has contracted in his indolent and luxurious climate the need of excitement by irri- tating and tormenting his slavea Sir Lionel Smith defended the poor negro girls, prey to the licentiousness of the planters; they shall not be whipped witb B42 E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S tamarind rods if they do not comply with their master's will; he defended the negro women; they should not be made to dig the cane-holes ( which is the very hardest of the field work); be defended the Baptist preachers and the stipendiary magis. trates, who are the negroes' friends, from the power of the planter. The power of the planters, however, to oppress, was greater than the power of the apprentice and of his guardians to withstand. Lord Brougham and Mr. Buxton declared that the planter had not fulfilled his part in the contract, whilst the ap- prentices had fulfilled theirs; and demanded that the elnancipa- tion should be hastened, and the apprenticeship abolished.

In British Guiana, in Dominica, the ~ arne resolution had been earlier taken with more good will; and the other islands fell into the measure; so that on the 1St August, 1838, the shackles dropped from every British slave. The ac .. counts which we have from all parties, both from the planters {and those too who were originally most opposed to the measure) , and from the new freemen, are of the most satisfactory kind. 'fhe manner in which the new festival was celebrated, brings tears to the eyes. The First of August, 1838, was observed in Jamaica as a day of thanksgiving and prayer. Sir Lionel Smith, the governor, writes to the British Ministry, \"It is impossible tor me to do justice tothe good order, decorum and gratitude which the whole laboring popUlation manifested on that happy occa- sion. Though joy beamed on every countenance, it was through .. out tempered with solemn thankfulness to God, and the churches and chapels were everywhere filled with these happy people in humble offering of praise.\" Th.e Queen, in her speech to the Lords and Commons, praised the conduct of the emancipated population: and in 1840 Sir Charles Metcalfe, the new governor of Jamaica, in his address to the Assembly expressed himself to that late exasperated body E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE", "speech to the Lords and Commons, praised the conduct of the emancipated population: and in 1840 Sir Charles Metcalfe, the new governor of Jamaica, in his address to the Assembly expressed himself to that late exasperated body E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S 84~ in these terms: \"All those who are acquainted with the state of the island know that our emancipated population are as free, as independent in their conduct, as well conditioned, as much in the enjoyment of abundance, and as strongly sensible of the bless- ings of liberty, as any that we know of in any country. All dis- qualifications and distinctions of color have ceased; men of all colors have equal rights in law, and an equal footing in society, and every man's position is settled by the same circumstances which regulate that point in other free countries, where no differ- ence of color exists. It may be asserted, without fear of denial, that the former slaves of Jamaica are now as secure in all social rights, as freeborn Britons.\" He further describes the erection of numerous churches, chapels and schools which the new popula ... tion required, and adds that more are still demanded. The legis ... lature, in their reply, echo the governor's statement, and say, \"The peaceful demeanor of the emancipated population re- dounds to their own credit, and affords a proof of their continued comfort and prosperity.\" I said, this event is signal in the history of civilization.

It is that of a trading nation; it is a shopkeeping civility. The English lord is a retired shopkeeper, and has the prejudices and timidities of that profession. And we are shopkeepers, and have acquired the vices and virtues that belong to trade. We peddle, we truck, we sail, we row, we ride in cars, we creep in teams, we go in canals-to market, and for the sale of goods. The national aim and employment streams into our ways of thinking, our laws, our habits and our manners. The customer is the imme- diate jewel of our souls. Him we flatter, him we feast, compli- 'Ilnent, vote for, and will not contradict. It was, or it seemed the dictate of trade, to keep the negro down. We had found a race who were less warlike, and less energetic shopkeepers than we; who had very little skill in trade. We found it very convenient to keep them at work, since, by the aid of a little whipping, we could get their work for nothing but their board and the cost of whips. What if it cost a few unpleasant scenes on the coast of Africa? That was a great way off; and the scenes could be en .. dured by some sturdy, unscrupulous fellows, who could go, for high wages, and bring us the men, and need not trouble our ears with the disagreeable particulars.

You could not educate him, you could not get any poetry, any wisdom, any beauty in woman, any strong and commanding character in man, but these absurdities would still come flashing out--these absurdities of a demand for justice, a generosity for the weak and oppressed. Unhappily, too, for the planter, the laws of nature are in harmony with each other: that which the head and the heart demand is found to be, in the long run, for what the grossest calculator calls his ad- vantage. The moral sense is always supported by the permanent interest of the parties. Else, I know not how, in our world, any good would ever get done.

Else, I know not how, in our world, any good would ever get done. It was shown to the planters that they, as well as the negroes, were slaves; that though they paid no wages, they got very poor work; that their estates were ruining them, under the finest climate; and that they needed the se- verest monopoly laws at home to keep them from bankruptcy_ The oppression of the slave recoiled on them. They were full of vices; their children were lumps of pride, sloth, sensuality and rottenness. The position of woman was nearly as bad as it could be; and, like other robbers, they could not sleep in security_ Many planters have said, since the emancipation, that, before that day, they were the greatest slaves on the estates. Slavery is no scholar, no improver; it does not love the whistle of the rail- road; it does not love the newspaper; the mail-bag, a college, a book or a preacher who has the absurd whim of saying what he thinks; it does not increase the white population; it does not im- ~rove the soil; everything goes to decay. For these reasons the islands proved bad customers to England. It was very easy for manufacturers less shrewd than those of Birmingham and Man ... chester to see that if the state of things in the islands was alteredr if the slaves had wages, the slaves would be clothed, would build houses, would fill them with tools, with pottery, with crock- ery, with hardware; and negro women love fine clothes as well as white women.

But the trade could not be abolished whilst this hungry West Indian market, with an appetite like the grave, cried, 'More, more, bring me a hundred a day;' they could not expect any mitigation in the madness of the poor African war- chiefs. These considerations opened the eyes of the dullest in Britain. More than this, the West Indian estate was owned or mortgaged in England, and the owner and the mortgagee had very plain intimations that the feeling of English liberty was gaining every hour new mass and velocity, and the hostility to such as resisted it would be fatal. The House of Commons would destroy the protection of island produce, and interfere in English politics in the island legislation: so they hastened to make the best of their position, and accepted the bilL These considerations, I doubt not, had their weight; the in- terest of trade, the interest of the revenue, and, moreover, the good fame of the action.

On reviewing this history, I think the whole transaction reflects infinite honor on the people and par- liament of England. It was a stately spectacle, to see the cause of human rights argued with so much patience and generosity and with such a mass of evidence before that powerful people. It is a creditable incident in the history that when, in 1789, the first privy council report of evidence on the trade (a bulky folio embodying all the facts which the London Committee had been engaged for years in collecting, and all the examinations before the council) was presented to the House of Commons, a late day being named for the discussion, in order to give members time-- Mr. Wilberforce, Mr. Pitt, the Prime Minister, and other gentle- men, took advantage of the postponement to retire into the COWl- try to read the report; For months and years the bill was debated, with some consciousness of the extent of its relations, by the first citizens of England, the foremost men of the earth; every argu- ment was weighed, every particle of evidence was sifted and laid in the scale; and, at last, the right triumphed, the poor man was vindicated, and the oppressor was fiung out.

The extent of the empire, and the magnitude and number of other questions crowding into court, keep this one in balance, and prevent it from obtaining that ascendency, and being urged with that intemper'\" ance which a question of property tends to acquire. There are causes in the composition of the British legislature, and the relaJ tion of its leaders to the country and to Europe, which exclude much that is pitiful and injurious in other legislative assemblies, From these reasons, the question was discussed with a rare inde'\" pendence and magnanimity. It was not narrowed down to a. paltry electioneering trap; and, I must say, a delight in justice, an honest tenderness for the poor negro, for man suffering these wrongs, combined with the national pride, which refused to give the support of English soil or the protection of the English flag to these disgusting violations of nature. Forgive me, fellow citizens, if lawn to you, that in the last few days that my attention has been occupied with this history, I have not been able to read a page of it without the most painful comparisons.

Gentlemen, I thought the deck of a Massachusetts ship was as much the territory of Massachusetts as the floor on which we stand. It should be as sacred as the temple of God. The poorest fishing-smack that floats under the shadow of an iceberg in the Northern seas, or hunts whale in the Southern ocean, should be encompassed by her laws with comfort and protection, as much as within the arms of Cape Ann or Cape Cod. And this kidnapping is suffered within our own land and federation, whilst the fourth article of the Constitution of the United States ordains in terms, that, \"The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citi- zens in the several States.\" If such a damnable outrage can be committed on the person of a citizen with impunity, let the Gov .. ernor break. the broad seal of the State; he bears the sword in vain. The Governor of Massachusetts is a trifler; the State- House in Boston is a play-house; the General Court is a dis- honored body, if they make laws which they cannot execute.

It is so easy to omit to speak, or even to be absent when delicate things are to be handled.

This event was a moral revolution. The history of it is before you. Here was no prodigy, no fabulous hero, no Trojan horse, no bloody war, but all was achieved by plain means of plain men, working not under a leader, but under a sentiment.

The end was noble and the means were pure. Hence the elevation and pathos of this chapter of history. The lives of the advocates are pages of greatness, and the connection of the en1inent sen- ators with this question constitutes the immortalizing moments 9\u00a3 those men's lives. The bare enunciation of the theses at which EMANCIPATION IN WEST INDIES 851 the lawyers and legislators arrived, gives a glow to the heart of the reader. Lord Chancellor Northington is the author of the' famous sentence, \"As soon as any man puts his foot on English ground, he becomes free.\" \"1 was a slave,\" said the counsel of Somerset, speaking for his client, \"for I was in America: I am now in a country where the common rights of mankind are known and regarded.\" Granville Sharpe filled the ear of the judges with the sound", "English ground, he becomes free.\" \"1 was a slave,\" said the counsel of Somerset, speaking for his client, \"for I was in America: I am now in a country where the common rights of mankind are known and regarded.\" Granville Sharpe filled the ear of the judges with the sound principles that had from time to time been affirmed by the legal authorities: \"Derived power cannot be superior to the power from which it is derived:\" \"The reasonable- ness of the law is the soul of the law:\" \"It is better to suffer every evil, than to consent to any.\" Out it would come, the God's truth, out it came, like a bolt from a cloud, for all the mumbling of the lawyers. One feels very sensibly in all this history that a great heart and soul are behind there, superior to any man, and Inaking use of each, in turn, and infinitely attractive to every person according to the degree of reason in his own mind, so that this cause has had the power to draw to it every particle of talent and of worth in England, from the beginning. All the great geniuses of the British senate, Fox, Pitt, Burke, Grenville, Sber .. idan, Grey, Canning, ranged themselves on its side; the poet Cowper wrote for it: Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, in this country, all recorded their votes. All men remember the subtlety and the fire of indignation which the \"Edinburgh Review\" con- tributed to the cause; and every liberal mind, poet, preacher, moralist, statesman, has had the fortune to appear somewhere for this cause. On the other part, appeared the reign of pounds and shillings, and all manner of rage and stupidity; a resistance which drew from Mr. Huddlestone in Parliament the observa- tion, \"That a curse attended", "liberal mind, poet, preacher, moralist, statesman, has had the fortune to appear somewhere for this cause. On the other part, appeared the reign of pounds and shillings, and all manner of rage and stupidity; a resistance which drew from Mr. Huddlestone in Parliament the observa- tion, \"That a curse attended this trade even in the mode of defending it. By a certain fatality, none but the vilest arguments were brought forward, which corrupted the very persons who used them. Everyone of these was built on the narrow ground \u2022 of interest, of pecuniary profit, of sordid gain, in opposition to every motive that had reference to humanity, justice, and re ... ligion, or to that great principle which comprehended them all.\" This moral force perpetually reinforces and dignifies the friends 852 E M A .N C I PAT ION IN W EST I N DIE S of this cause. It gave that tenacity to their point which has In\u00b7\u00b7 ~ured ultimate triumph; and it gave that superiority in reason, in imagery, in eloquence, which makes in all countries anti .. slavery meetings so attractive to the people, and has made it a proverb in Massachusetts, that \"eloquence is dog-cheap at the anti-slavery chapel.\" I will say further that we are indebted mainly to this move- ment and to the continuers of it, for the popular discussion of every point of practical ethics, and a reference of every question to the absolute standard. It is notorious that the political, re- ligious and social schemes, with which the minds of men are now most occupied, have been matured, or at least broached, in the free and daring discussions of these assemblies. Men have become aware, through the emancipation and kindred events, of the presence of powers which, in their days of darkness,", "and social schemes, with which the minds of men are now most occupied, have been matured, or at least broached, in the free and daring discussions of these assemblies. Men have become aware, through the emancipation and kindred events, of the presence of powers which, in their days of darkness, they had overlooked. Virtuous men will not agaia rely on political agents. They have found out the deleterious effect of political associa- tion. Up to this day we have allowed to statesmen a paramount social standing, and we bow low to them as to the great. We cannot extend this deference to them any longer. The secret cannot be kept, that the seats of power are filled by underlings, ignorant, timid and selfish to a degree to destroy all claim, ex- cepting that on compassion, to the society of the just and gen .. erous. What happened notoriously to an American alnbassador in England, that he found himself compelled to palter and to dis ... guise the fact that he was a slave-breeder, happens to men of state. Their vocation is a presumption against them among well- meaning people. The superstition respecting power and office is going to the ground. The stream of human affairs flows its own way, and is very little affected by the activity of legislators. What great masses of men wish done, will be done; and they do not wish it for a freak, but because it is their state and natural end ..

The tendency of things runs steadily to this point, namely, to put every man on his merits, and to give him EM A N C I PAT ION IN WE S TIN DIE S 853 so much power as he naturally exerts-no more, no less. Of course, the timid and base persons, all who are conscious of no worth in themselves, and who owe all their place to the opportu\u00b7 .. nities which the older order of things allowed them, to deceive and defraud men, shudder at the change, and would fain silence every honest voice, and lock up every house where liberty and innovation can be pleaded for. They would raise mobs, for fear is very cruel. But the strong and healthy yeomen and husbands of the land, the self-sustaining class of inventive and industrious men, fear no competition or superiority. Coril\u20ac what will, their faculty cannot be spared. The First of August marks the entrance of a new element into modern politics, namely, the civilization of the negro. A man is added to the human family. Not the least affecting part of this history of abolition is the annihilation of the old indecent non\" sense about the nature of the negro. In the case of the ship Zong, in 178!, whose master had thrown one hundred and thirty-twa slaves alive into the sea, to cheat the underwriters, the first jury gave a verdict in favor of the master and owners: they had a right to do what they had done. Lord Mansfield is reported to have said on the bench, \"The matter left", "thrown one hundred and thirty-twa slaves alive into the sea, to cheat the underwriters, the first jury gave a verdict in favor of the master and owners: they had a right to do what they had done. Lord Mansfield is reported to have said on the bench, \"The matter left to the jury is-Was it from necessity? For they had no doubt-though it shocks one very much-that the case of slaves was the same as if horses had been thrown overboard. It is a very shocking case.\" But a more enlightened and humane opinion began to prevail. Mr. Clarkson, early in his career, made a collection of African produc~ tions and manufactures, as specimens of the arts and culture of the negro; comprising cloths and 100m, weapons, polished stones and woods, leather, glass, dyes, ornaments, soap1 pipe-bowls and trinkets. These he showed to Mr. Pitt, who saw and handled them with extreme interest. \"On sight of these,\" says Clarkson, \"many sublime thoughts seemed to rush at once into his mind, some of which he expressed\"; and hence appeared to arise a project which was always dear to him, of the civilization of Africa-a dream which forever elevates his fame. In 1791 , Mr. Wilberforce announced to the House of Commons, \"We have already gained one victory: we have obtained for these pool Ir' j , \\ 854 E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S t:reatures the recognition of their human nature, which for a time was most shamefully denied them.\" It was the sarcasm of Montesquieu, \"it would not do to suppose that negroes were men, lest it should turn out that whites were not\"; for the white . has, for ages, done what he could to keep the negro in that hoggish", "a time was most shamefully denied them.\" It was the sarcasm of Montesquieu, \"it would not do to suppose that negroes were men, lest it should turn out that whites were not\"; for the white . has, for ages, done what he could to keep the negro in that hoggish state. His laws have been furies. It now appears that the negro race is, more than any other, susceptible of rapid civilization. The emancipation is observed, in the islands, to have wrought for the negro a benefit as sudden as when a ther- mometer is brought out of the shade into the sun. It has given him eyes and ears. If, before, he was taxed with such stupidity, or such defective vision, that he could not set a table square to the walls of an apartment, he is now the principal if not the only mechanic in the West Indies; and is, besides, an architect, a physician, a lawyer, a magistrate, an editor, and a valued and increasing political power. The recent testimonies of Sturge, of Thome and Kimball, of Gurney, of Philippo, are very explicit on this point, the capacity and the success of the colored and the black popUlation in employment of skill, of profit and of trust; and best of all is the testimony to their moderation. They receive hints and advances from the whites that they will be gladly received as subscribers to the Exchange, as members of this or that committee of trust. They hold back, and say to each .other that \"social position is not to be gained by pushing.\" I have said that this event interests us because it came mainly from the concession of the whites; I add, that in part it is the earning of the blacks.

They won the pity and respect which they have received, by their powers and native endowments. I think this a circumstance of the highest import. Their whole future is in it. Our planet, before the age of written history, had its races of savages, like the generations of sour paste, or the animalcules that wiggle and bite in a drop of putrid water. Who cares for these or for their wars? We do not wish a world of bugs or of birds; neither afterward of Scythians, Caraibs or Feejees. The grand style of Nature, her great periods, is all we observe in them. Who cares for oppressing whites, or oppressed b1acks~ twenty centuries ago; more than for bad dreams? Eaters EM AN C I P A -r ION IN WE S TIN DIE S BSS and food are in the harmony of Nature; and there too is the germ forever protected, unfolding gigantic leaf after leaf, a newer flower, a richer fruit, in every period, yet its next product is never to be guessed. It will only save what is worth saving; and it saves not by compassion, but by power. It appoints no police to guard the lion but his teeth and claws; no fort or city for the bird but his wings; no rescue for flies and mites but their spawning numbers, -yvhich no ravages can uvercome. It deals with men after the same manner. If they are rude and foolish, down they must go. ,\\\\Then at last in a race a", "no fort or city for the bird but his wings; no rescue for flies and mites but their spawning numbers, -yvhich no ravages can uvercome. It deals with men after the same manner. If they are rude and foolish, down they must go. ,\\\\Then at last in a race a new principle appears, an idea-that conserves it; ideas only save races. If the black man is feeble and not important to the existing races, not on a parity with the best race, the black man must serve, and be exterlninated. But if the black man carries in his bosom an indispensable element of a new and coming civilization; for the sake of that element, no wrong nor strength nor circumstance can hurt him: he will survive and play his part. So now, the arrival in the world of such men as Toussaint, and the Haytian heroes, or of the leaders of their race in Barbadoes and Jamaicas outweighs in good omen all the English and American humanity. The anti-slavery of the whole world is dust in the balance before this-is a poor squeamishness and nervousness: the might and the right are here: here is the anti-slave: here is man: and if you have man, black or white is an insignificance. The intellect -that is miraculous! Who has it, has the talisman: his skin and bones, though they were of the color of night, are transparent, and the everlasting stars shine through, with attractive beams~ But a compassion for that which is not and cannot be useful or lovely, is degrading and futile.

I say to you, you must save yourself, black or white, man or woman; other help is none. I esteem the occasion of this jubilee to be the proud discovery that the black race can contend with the white: that in the great anthem which we call history, a piece of many parts and vast compass, after playing a long time a very low and subdued accompaniment, they o~rceive the time arrived when they cap 856 E MAN C I PAT ION I N W EST I N DIE S strike in with effect and take a master's part in the music. The civility of the world has reached that pitch that their more moral genius is becoming indispensable, and the quality of this race is to be honored for itself. For this, they have been preserved in sandy deserts, in rice-swamps, in kitchens and shoe-shops, so long: now let them emerge, clothed and in their own form. There remains the very elevated consideration which the sub .. ject opens, but which belongs to more abstract views than we are now taking, this, namely, that the civility of no race can be perfect whilst another race is degraded. It is a doctrine alike of the oldest and of the newest philosophy, that man is one, and that you cannot injure any member, without a sympathetic injury to all the members. America is not civil, whilst Africa is barbarous. These considerations seem to leave no choice for the action of the intellect and the conscience of the country_ There have been moments in this, as", "one, and that you cannot injure any member, without a sympathetic injury to all the members. America is not civil, whilst Africa is barbarous. These considerations seem to leave no choice for the action of the intellect and the conscience of the country_ There have been moments in this, as well as in every piece of moral history, when there seemed room for the infusions of a skeptical philoso- phy; when it seemed doubtful whether brute force would not triumph in the eternal struggle. I doubt not that, sometimes, a despairing negro, when jumping over the ship's sides to escape from the white devils who surrounded him, has believed there was no vindication of right; it is horrible to think of, but it seemed so. I doubt not that sometimes the negro's friend, in the face of scornful and brutal hundreds of traders and drivers, has felt his heart sink. Especially, it seems to me, some degree of despondency is pardonable, when he observes the men of con- science and of intellect, his own natural allies and champions- those whose attention should be nailed to the grand objects of this cause, so hotly offended by whatever incidental petulances or infirmities of indiscreet defenders of the negro; as to permit themselves to be ranged with the enemies of the human race; and names which should be the alarums of liberty and the watch- words of truth, are mixed up with all the rotten rabble of selfish- BeSS and tyranny. I assure myself that this coldness and blind .. :ness will pass away. A single noble wind of sentiment will scatter them forever.

I am sure that the good and wise elders, the ardent EMANCIPATION IN WEST INDIES 857 and generous youth, will not permit what is incidental and exceptional to withdraw their devotion from the essential and permanent characters of the question. There have been moments, I said, when men might be forgiven who doubted. Those mo- ments are past. Seen in masses, it cannot be disputed, there is progress in human society. There is a blessed necessity by whicb. the interest of men is always driving them to the right; and, again, making all crime mean and ugly. The genius of the Saxon race, friendly to liberty; the enterprise, the very muscular vigor of this nation, are inconsistent with slavery. The Intellect, with blazing eye, looking through history from the beginning onward, gazes on this blot and it disappears. The sentiment of Right, once very low and indistinct, but ever more articulate, because it is the voice of the universe, pronounces Freedom. The Power that built this fabric of things affirms it in the heart; and in the history of the First of August, has made a sign to the ages, of his will. THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW [This is one of two addresses on the sa1ne subject by Em.erson. He gave the first in Concord on May 3, 185 I. Fugitive slaves were constantly passing through Concord in those days and we1'e helped on their way by various individuals.

THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW I DO not often speak to public questions-they are odious and hurtful, and it seems like meddling or leaving your work. I have my own spirits in prison-spirits in deeper prisons, whom no man visits if I do not. And then I see what havoc it makes with any good mind, a dissipated philanthropy. The one thing not to be forgiven to intellectual persons is, not to know their own task, or to take their ideas from others. From this want of manly rest in their own and rash acceptance of other people's watchwords come the imbecility and fatigue of their conversa- tion. For they cannot affirm these from any original experi .. ence, and of course not with the natural movement and total strength of their nature and talent, but only from their memory, only from their cramped position of standing for their teacher.", "the imbecility and fatigue of their conversa- tion.

They say what they would have you believe, but what they d1) not quite know. My own habitual view is to the well-being of students or scholars. And it is only when the public event affects them, that it very seriously touches me. And what I have to say is to them. For every man speaks mainly to a class whom he works with and more or less fully represents. It is to these I am before- hand related and engaged, in this audience or out of it-to them and not to others. And yet, when I say the class of scholars or students-that is a class which comprises in some sort all man- kind, comprises every man in the best hours of his life; and in these days not only virtually but actually. For who are the readers and thinkers of I8S4? Owing to the silent revolution which the newspaper has wrought, this class has come in this country to take in all classes. Look into the morning trains which, from every suburb, carry the business men into the city to their shops, counting-rooms, work-yards and warehouses.

There is, no doubt, chaff enough in what he brings; but there is fact, thought, and wisdom in the crude mass, from all regions of the world. I have lived all my life without suffering any known incon- venience from American Slavery. I never saw it; I never heard the whip; I never felt the check on my free speech and action, until, the other day, when Mr. Webster, by his per- sonal influence, brought the Fugitive Slave Law on the coun- try_ I say I\\1r. Webster, for though the Bill was not his, it is j1et notorious that he was the life and soul of it, that he gave it all he had: it cost hIm his life, and under the shadow of his great name inferior men sheltered themselves, tbrew their ballots for it and made the law. I say inferior men. There were all sorts of what are called brilliant men, accomplished men, men of high station, a President of the United States, Senators, men of eloquent speech, but men without self .. respect, without character, and it was strange to see that office, age, fame, talent, even a repute for honesty, all count for nothing. They had no opinions, they had no memory for what they had been saying like the Lord's Prayer all their lifetime: they were only looking to what their great Captain did: if he jumped, they jumped, if he stood on his head, they did.

They had no opinions, they had no memory for what they had been saying like the Lord's Prayer all their lifetime: they were only looking to what their great Captain did: if he jumped, they jumped, if he stood on his head, they did. In ordinary, the supposed sense of their district and State is their guide, and that holds them to the part of liberty and ju\u00a3tice. But it is always a little difficult to decipher what this public sense is; and when a great man comes who knots up into himself the opinions and wishes of the people, it is so much easier to follow him as an exponent of this. He too is responsible; they will not be. It will always suffice to say-CCl followed him.\" I saw plainly that the great show their legitimate power in nothing more than in their power to misguide us. I saw that a great man, deservedly admired for his powers and their general right direction, was able-fault of the total want of stamina in THE F U G I TIt A S, 1. A VEL A W 863 public men-when he failed, to l)reak them all with him, to carry parties with him. In wha.t I have to say of Mr. Webster I do not confound him with vulgar politicians before or since. There is always base ambition enough, men who calculate on the immense ignorance of the masses; that is their quarry and farm.: they use the con- stituencies at home only for their shoes. And, of course, they can drive out from the contest any honorable man. The low can best win the low, and all men like to be made much of.

The low can best win the low, and all men like to be made much of. There are those too who have power and inspiration only to do ill. Their talent or their faculty deserts them when they undertake anything right. Mr. Webster had a natural ascendancy of aspect and carriage which distinguished him over all his contemporaries~ His countenance, his figure, and his manners were all in so grand a style, that he was, without effort, as superior to his most emi ... nent rivals as they were to the humblest; so that his arrival in any place was an event which drew crowds of people, who went to satisfy their eyes, and could not see him enough. I think they looked at him as the representative of the American Continent .. He was there in his Adamitic capacity, as if he alone of all men did not disappoint the eye and the ear, but was a fit figure in the landscape. I remember his appearance at Bunker's Hill. There was the Monument, and here was Webster. He knew well that a little more or less of rhetoric signified nothing: he was only to say plain and equal things-grand things if he had them, and, if he had them not, only to abstain from saying unfit things-and the whole occasion was answered by his presence. It was a place for behavior more than for speech, and Mr. Webster walked through his part with entire success. His excellent organization, the perfection of his elocution and all that thereto belongs- voice, accent, intonation, attitude, manner-we shall not soon find again. Then he was so thoroughly simple and wise in his", "place for behavior more than for speech, and Mr. Webster walked through his part with entire success. His excellent organization, the perfection of his elocution and all that thereto belongs- voice, accent, intonation, attitude, manner-we shall not soon find again. Then he was so thoroughly simple and wise in his rhetoric; he saw through his matter, hugged his fact so close, went to the principle or essential, and never indulged in a weak flourish, though he knew perfectly well how to make such ex- ordiums, episodes and perorations as might give perspective to 864 THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W his harangues without in the least embarrassing his march or confounding his transitions. In his statement things lay in day- light; we saw them in order as they were. Though he kne'\\v very well how to present his own personal claims, yet in his arg'1ment he was intellectual-stated his fact pure of all personality, so that his splendid wrath, when his eyes became lamps, was the wrath of the fact and the cause he stood for. His power, like that of all great masters, was not in excellent parts, but was total. lIe had a great and everywhere equal pro- priety. He worked with that closeness of adhesion to the matter in hand which a joiner or a chemist uses, and the same quiet and sure feeling of right to his place that an oak or a mountain have to theirs. After all his talents have been described, there remains that perfect propriety which animated all the details of the action or speech with the character of the whole, so that his beauties of detail are endless.

He seemed born for the bar, born for the senate, and took very naturally a leading part in large private and in public affairs; for his head distributed things in their right places, and what he saw so well he compelled other people to see also. Great is the privilege of eloquence. What gratitude does every man feel to him who speaks well for the right-who translates truth into language entirely plain and ~learl The history of this country has given a disastrous importance to the defects of this great man's mind. Whether evil influences and the corruption of politics, or whether original infirmity, it was the misfortune of his country that with this large under- standing he had not what is better than intellect, and the source of its health. It is a law of our nature that great thoughts come from the heart. If his moral sensibility had been proportioned to the force of his understanding, what limits could have been set to his genius and beneficent power? But he wanted that deep source of inspiration. Hence a sterility of thought, the want of generalization in his speeches, and the curious fact that, with a general ability which impresses all the world, there is not a single general remark, not an observation on life and manners, not an aphorism that can pass into literature from his writings. THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W 865 Four years ago to-night, on one of those high critical moments in history when great issues are determined, when", "on life and manners, not an aphorism that can pass into literature from his writings. THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W 865 Four years ago to-night, on one of those high critical moments in history when great issues are determined, when the powers of right and wrong are mustered for conflict, and it lies with one man to give a casting vote-Mr. Webster, most unex- pectedly, threw his whole weight on the side of Slavery, and caused by his personal and official authority the passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill. It is remarked of the Americans that they value dexterity too much, and honor too little; that they think they praise a man more by saying that he is \"smart\" than by saying that he is right. Whether the defect be national or not, it is the defect and calamity of Mr. Webster; and it is so far true of his countrymen, namely, that the appeal is sure to be made to his physical and mental ability when his character is assailed. His speeches on the seventh of March, and at Albany, at Buffalo, at Syracuse and Boston are cited in justification. And Mr. Webster's literary editor believes that it was his wish to rest his fame on the speech of the seventh of March. Now, though I have my own opinions on this seventh of March discourse and those others, and think them very transparent and very open to criticism-yet the secon- dary merits of a speech, namely, its logic, its illustrations, its points, etc., are not here in question. Nobody doubts that Daniel Webster could make a good speech. Nobody doubts that there were good and plausible things to be said on the part of the South. But this", "the secon- dary merits of a speech, namely, its logic, its illustrations, its points, etc., are not here in question. Nobody doubts that Daniel Webster could make a good speech. Nobody doubts that there were good and plausible things to be said on the part of the South. But this is not a question of ingenuity, not a question of syllogisms, but of sides. How came he there? There are always texts and thoughts and arguments. But it is the genius and temper of the man which decides whether he will stand for right or for might. Who doubts the power of any fluent debater to defend either of our political parties, or any client in our courts? There was the same law in England for Jeffries and Talbot and Yorke to read slavery out of, and for Lord Mansfield to read freedom. And in this country one sees that there is always margin enough in the statute for a liberal judge to read one way and a servile judge another. But the question which History will ask is broader. In the final hour, when he was forced by the peremptory necessity of 866 THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W the closing armies to take a side-did he take the part of great principles, the side of humanity and justice, or the side of abuse and oppression and chaos? Mr. Webster decided for Slavery, and that, when the aspect of the institution was no longer doubtful, no longer feeble and apologetic and proposing soon to end itself, but when it was ~trong, aggressive, and threatening an illin1itable increase.

He listened to State reasons and hopes, and left, with much conl- placency we are told, the testament of his speech to the aston- ished State of !Vlassachusetts, vera pro gratis; a ghastly result of all those years of experience in affairs, this, that there was nothing better for the foremost American n1an to tell his coun ... trymen than that Slavery was now at that strength that they must beat down their conscience and become kidnappers for it. This was like the doleful speech falsely ascribed to the patriot Brutus: \"Virtue, I have followed thee through life, and I find thee but a shadow.\". Here was a question of an imn10ral law; a question agitated for ages, and settled always in the same way by every great jurist, that an immoral law cannot be valid. Cicero, Grotius, Coke, Blackstone, Burlamaqui, Vattel, Burke, Jefferson, do all affirm this, and I cite them, not that they can give evidence to what is indisputable, but because, though lawyers and practical statesmen, the habit of their profession did not hide from them that this truth was the fouBdation of States. Here was the question, Are you for man and for the good of man; or are you for the hurt and harm of man? It was the ques- tion whether man shall be treated as leather? Whether the negro shall be, as the Indians were in Spanish Alnerica, a piece of money? Whether this system, which is a kind of mill or factory for converting men into monkeys, shall be upheld and enlarged? And Mr. Webster and the country went for the application to these poor", "Whether the negro shall be, as the Indians were in Spanish Alnerica, a piece of money? Whether this system, which is a kind of mill or factory for converting men into monkeys, shall be upheld and enlarged? And Mr. Webster and the country went for the application to these poor men of quadruped law. People were expecting a totally different course from Mr, Webster. If any man had in that hour possessed the weight with the country which he had acquired, he could have brought the whole country to its senses. But not a moment's pause was THE F U G I T I V E ~ L A VEL A W 867 allowed. Angry parties went from bad to worse, and the decision of Webster was accompanied with everything offensive to free .. dam and good morals. There was something like an attempt to debauch the moral sentiment of the clergy and of the youth. Burke said he \"would pardon something to the spirit of liberty.\" But by 1Ylr. Webster the opposition to the law was sharply called treason, and prosecuted so. He told the people at Boston \"they must conquer their prejudices\"; that \"agitation of the subject of Slavery must be suppressed.\" 'He did as immoral men usually do, made very low bows to the Christian Church, and went through all the Sunday decorums; but when allusion was made to the question of duty and the sanctions of morality, he very frankly said, at Albany, \"Some higher law, something existing. somewhere between here and the third heaven-I do not know where.\" And if the 1 eporters say true, this wretched atheism, tound some laughter in the company. I said I had never in my life up to this time suffered from the Slave Institution. Slavery in Virginia or", "something existing. somewhere between here and the third heaven-I do not know where.\" And if the 1 eporters say true, this wretched atheism, tound some laughter in the company. I said I had never in my life up to this time suffered from the Slave Institution. Slavery in Virginia or Carolina was like Slavery in ,i\\frica or the Feejees, for me. There was an old fugitive law, but it had become, or was fast becoming, a dead letter, and, by the genius and laws of Massachusetts, inoperative. The new Bill made it operative, required me to hunt slaves, and it found citi- zens in Massachusetts willing to act as judges and captors. Moreover, it discloses the secret of the new times, that Slavery was no longer mendicant, but was become aggressive and dan- gerous. The way in which the country was dragged to consent to this, and the disastrous defection (on the miserable cry of Union) of the men of letters, of the colleges, of educated men, nay, of some preachers of religion-was the darkest passage in the his ... tory. It showed that our prosperity had hurt us, and that we could not be shocked by crime. It showed that the old religion and the sense of the right bad faded and gone out; that while we reckoned ourselves a highly cultivated nation, our bellies had run away with our brains, and the principles of culture and progress did not exist. For I suppose that liberty is an accurate index, in men and 868 THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W nations, of general progress. The theory of personal liberty must always appeal to the most refined communities and to the men of the rarest perception and of delicate moral sense.", "index, in men and 868 THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W nations, of general progress. The theory of personal liberty must always appeal to the most refined communities and to the men of the rarest perception and of delicate moral sense. For there are rights which rest on the finest sense of justice, and, with every degree of civility, it will be more truly felt and defined. A bar .. barous tribe of good stock will, by means of their best heads, secure substantial liberty . But where there is any weakness in a race, and it becomes in a degree matter of concession and pro- tection from their stronger neighbors, the incompatibility and offensiveness of the wrong will of course be most evident to the most cultivated. For it is-is it not?-the essence of courtesy, of politeness, of religion, of love, to prefer another, to postpone oneself, to protect another from oneself. That is the distinction of the gentleman, to defend the weak and redress the injured, as ,it is of the savage and the brutal to usurp and use others. In Massachusetts, as we all know, there has always existed a predominant conservative spirit. We have more money and value ~f every kind than other people, and wish to keep them. The plea ~n which freedom was resisted was Union. I went to certain serious men, who had a little more reason than the rest, and inquired why they took this part? They answered that they had ne confidence in their strength to resist the Democratic party; that they saw plainly that all was going to the utmost verge of licence; each was vying with his neighbor to lead the party, by proposing the worst measure, and they threw", "took this part? They answered that they had ne confidence in their strength to resist the Democratic party; that they saw plainly that all was going to the utmost verge of licence; each was vying with his neighbor to lead the party, by proposing the worst measure, and they threw themselves on the extreme conservatism, as a drag on the wheel: that they knew Cuba would be had, and Mexico would be had, and they stood stiffly on conservatism, and as near to monarchy as they could, t>n1y to moderate the velocity with which the car was running down the precipice. In short, their theory was despair; the Whig wisdom was only reprieve, a waiting to be last devoured. They side with Carolina, or with Arkansas, only to make a show of Whig strength, wherewith to resist a little longer this general ruin. I have a respect for conservatism. I know how deeply founded it is in our nature, and how idle are all attempts to shake our- selves free from it. We are all conservatives, half Whig, half THE F U G I T I V E 5 L A VEL A W 869 Democrat, in our essences: and might as well try to jump out of our skins as to escape from our Whiggery. There are two forces in Nature, by whose antagonism we exist; the power of Fate, Fortune, the laws of the world, the order of things, or however else we choose to phrase it, the material necessities, on the one hand-and Will or Duty or Freedom on the other. May and Must, and the sense of right and duty, on the one hand, and the material necessities on the other: May and l'vlust.

May and Must, and the sense of right and duty, on the one hand, and the material necessities on the other: May and l'vlust. In vulgar politics the Whig goes for what has been, for the old necessities-the Musts. The reformer goes for the Better, for the ideal good, for the Mays. But each of these parties must of necessity take in, in some measure, the principles of the other. Each wishes to cover the whole ground; to hold fast and to ad- vance. Only, one lays the emphasis on keeping, and the other on advancing. I too think the musts are a safe company to fol- low, and even agreeable. But if we are Whigs, let us be 'Vhigs of nature and science, and so for all the necessities. Let us know that, over and above all the musts of poverty and appetite, is the instinct of man to rise, and the instinct to love and help his brother. Now, Gentlemen, I think we have in this hour instruction again in the simplest lesson. Events roll, millions of men are engaged) and the result is the enforcing of some of those first command- ments which we heard in the nursery. ,\\Ve never get beyond our first lesson, for, really, the world exists, as I understand it, to teach the science of liberty, which begins with liberty from fear. The events of this month are teaching one thing plain and clear, the worthlessness of good tools to bad workmen; that offi- cial papers are of no use; resolutions of public meetings, plat ... forms of conventions, no, nor laws, nor constitutions, any more.

These are all declaratory of the will of the moment, and are passed with more levity and on grounds far less honorable than ordinary business transactions of the street. You relied on the constitution. It has not the word slave in it; and very good argument has shown that it would not warrant the crimes that are done under it; that, with provisions so vague for an object not named, and which could not be availed of to c]aim THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW a barrel of sugar or a barrel of corn, the robbing of a man and of an his posterity is effected. You relied on the Supreme Court. The law was right, excellent law for the lanlbs. But what if unhappily the judges were chosen froul the wolves, and give to all the law a wolfish interpretation? You relied on the Missouri ~ompromise. l\"hat is ridden over. You relied on State sover- eignty in the Free States to protect their citizens. They art driven with contempt out of the courts and out of the territory of the Slave States-if they are so happy as to get out with their lives-and now you relied on these dismal guaranties infamously made in 1850; and, before the body of Webster is yet crumbled, it is found that they have crumbled.

This eternal nlonument of his fame and of the Union is rotten in four years. They are no guaranty to the free states. They are a guaranty to the slave 'States that, as they have hitherto met with no repulse, they shall ,meet with none. I fear there is no reliance to be put on any kind or form of covenant, no, not on sacred forms, none on churches, none on bibles. For one would have said that a Christian would not keep slaves: but the Christians keep slaves. Of course they will not dare to read the Bible? Won't they? They quote the Bible, quote Paul, quote Christ, to justify slavery. If slavery is good, then is lying, theft, arson, homicide, each and all good, and to be main .. tained by Union societies. These things show that no forms, neither constitutions, nor laws, nor covenants, nor churches, nor bibles, are of any use in themselves. The Devil nestles comfortably into them all. There is no help but in the head and heart and hamstrings of a man. Covenants are of no use without honest men to keep them; laws of none but with loyal citizens to obey them. To interpret Christ it needs Christ in the heart. The teachings of the Spirit can be clpprebended only by the same spirit that gave them forth. To make good the cause of Freedom, you must draw off from all foolish trust in others. You must be citadels and warriors your- selves, declarations of Independence, the charter, the battle and the victory.

Then he protects New York. He only who is able to stand alone is qualified for society. And that I understand to be the end for which a soul exists in this world-to be himself the counterbalance of all falsehood and all wrong.

Why have the minority no influence? Because they have not a real minority of one. I conceive that thus to detach a man and make him feel that he is to owe all to himself, is the way to make him strong and rich; and here the optimist must find, if anywhere, the benefit of Slavery.

The insight of the religious sentiment will disclose to him unexpected aids in the nature of things. The Persian Saadi said, \"Beware of hurting the orphan. When the orphan sets a-crying, the throne of the Almighty is rocked from side to side.\" Whenever a man has come to this mind, that there is no Church for him but his believing prayer; no Constitution but his dealing well and justly with his neighbor; no liberty but his invincible will to do right-then certain aids and allies wiJl promptly appear: for the constitution of the Universe is on his side. It is of no use to vote down gravitation of morals.

He was created for benefit, and he exists for harm; and as well-doing makes power and wisdom, ill-doing takes them away. A man who steals another man's labor st.eals away his own faculties; his integrity, his humanity is fiowinuway from him. The habit of oppression cuts out the moral eyes, and, though the intellect goes on simulating the moral as before, its sanity is gradually destroyed. It takes away the presentiments. I suppose in general this is allowed, that if you have a nice question of right and wrong, you would not go with it to Louis Napoleon, or to a political hack, or to a slave-driver. The habit of mind of traders in power would not be esteemed favorable to delicate moral perception. American slavery affords no exception to this rule. No excess of good nature or of tenderness in indi .. viduals has been able to give a new character to the system, to tear down the whipping-house. The plea in the mouth of a slave- holder that the negro is an inferior race sounds very oddly in my ear. \"The masters of slaves seem generally anxious to prove that they are not of a race superior in any noble quality to the mean- est of", "the whipping-house. The plea in the mouth of a slave- holder that the negro is an inferior race sounds very oddly in my ear. \"The masters of slaves seem generally anxious to prove that they are not of a race superior in any noble quality to the mean- est of their bondmen.\" And indeed when the Southerner points to the anatomy of the negro, and talks of chimpanzee-I recall Montesquieu's remark, \"It will not do to say that negroes are men, lest it should turn out that whites are not.\" Slavery is disheartening; but Nature is not so helpless but it can rid itself at last of every wrong. But the spasms of Nature are centuries and ages, and will tax the faith of short-lived men.

The Anglo-Saxon race is proud and strong and selfish. They believe only in Anglo-Saxons. In 1825 Greece found America deaf, Poland found America deaf, Italy .3.nd Hungary found her deaf. England maintains trade, not lib- erty; stands against Greece; against Hungary; against Schles- wig-Holstein; against the French Republic whilst it was a repub- lic. To faint hearts the times offer no invitation, and torpor exis~ here throughout the active classes on the subject of domesti( slavery and its appalling aggressions. Yes, that is the stern edici of Providence, that liberty shall be no hasty fruit, but that event on event, population on population, age on age, shall cast itself into the opposite scale, and not until liberty has slowly accumu- lated weight enough to countervail and preponderate against all this, can the sufficient recoil come. All the great cities, all the refined circles, all the statesmen, Guizot, Palmerston, Webster, Calhoun, are sure to be found befriending liberty with their words, and crushing it with their votes. Liberty is never cheap. It is made difficult, because freedom is the accomplishment and perfectness of man. He is a finished man; earning and bestowing good: equal to the world; at home in Nature and dignifying 874 THE F U G I T I V E S L A VEL A W that; the sun does not see anything nobler, and has nothing to teach him.

Therefore mountains of difficulty must be sur .. mounted, stern trials met, wiles of seduction, dangers, healed by a quarantine of calamities to measure his strength before he dare say, I am free. Whilst the inconsistency of slavery with the principles on which the world is built guarantees its downfall, I own that the patience it requires is almost too sublime for mortals, and seems to demand of us more than mere hoping. And when one sees how fast the rot spreads-it is growing serious-I think we demand of superior men that they be superior in this-that the mind and the virtue shall give their verdict in their day, and accelerate so far the progress of civilization. Possession is sure to throw its stupid strength for existing power, and appetite and ambition .will go for that. Let the aid of virtue, intelligence and education be cast where they rightfully belong. They are organically ours. Let them be loyal to their own. I wish to see the instructed class here know their own flag, and not fire on their comrades. We should not forgive the clergy for taking on every issue the il~\u00ad -moral side; nor the Bench, if it put itself on the side of the ccl~ prit; nor the Government, if it sustain the mob against the law.

Without this assurance, he will sooner sink. He may well say, 'If my countrymen do not care to be defended, I too will decline the controversy, from which I only reap invectives and hatred.' Yet the lovers of liberty Inay with reason tax the cold- ness and indifferentism of scholars and literary men. They are lovers of liberty in Greece and ROlne and in the English Com~ monwealth, but they are lukewarm lovers of the liberty of America in 1854. The universities are not, as in Hobbes's time, \"the core of rebellion,\" no, but the seat of inertness. They have forgotten their allegiance to the Muse, and grown worldly and political.

It seemed, as the Turks say, \"Fate makes that a man should not believe his own eyes;\" But the Fugitive Law did much to unglue the eyes of men, and now the Nebraska Bill leaves us staring. The Anti-Slavery So- ciety will add many members this year. The Whig Party will join it; the Democrats will join it. The population of the free states will join it. I doubt not, at last, the slave states will join it. But be that sooner or later, and whoever comes or stays away, I hope we have reached the end of our unbelief, have come to a belief that there is a divine Providence in the world, which will not save us but througb our. own cooperation.

This commanding event which has brought us together\" eclipses all others which have occurred for a long time in our history, and I am very glad to see that this sudden interest in the hero of Harper's Ferry has provoked an extreme curiosity in all parts of the Republic, in regard to the details of his history. Every anecdote is eagerly sought, and I do not wonder that gentlenlen find traits of relation readily between him and them- selves. One finds a relation in the church, another in the profes .. sien, another in the place of his birth. He was happily a repre- sentative of the American Republic. Captain John Brown is a farmer, the fifth in descent from Peter Brown, who came to Ply- mouth in the Mayflower, in 1620. All the six have been farmers. His grandfather, of Simsbury, in Connecticut, was a captain in the Revolution. His father, largely interested as a raiser of stock, became a contractor to supply the army with beef, in the war ot 1812, and our Captain John Brown, then a boy, with his father was present and witnessed the surrender of General Hull. He cherishes a great respect for his father, as a man of strong charac- ter, and his respect is probably just. For himself, he is so trans- parent that all men see him through. He is a man to make friends wherever on learth courage and integrity are esteemed, the rarest of heroes, a pure idealist, with no by-ends of his own.

Many of you have seen him, and everyone who has heard him speak has been impressed alike by his simple, artless goodness, joined with his sublime courage. He joins that perfect Puritan faith which brought his fifth ancestor to Plymouth Rock with his grand- father's ardor in the Revolution. He believes in two articles- two instruments, shall I say?-the Golden Rule and the Decla- 879 880 JOHN BROWN ration of Independence; and he used this expression in conversa- tion here concerning thenl, \"Better that a whole generation of men, women and children should pass away by a violent death than that one word of either should be violated in this country.\" There is a Unionist-there is a strict constructionist for you. He believes in the Union of the States, and he conceives that the only obstruction to the Union is Slavery, and for that reason, as a patriot, he works for its abolition. The governor of Virginia has pronounced his eulogy in a manner that discredits the mod- eration of our timid parties. His own speeches to the court have interested the nation in him. What magnanimity, and what inno .. cent pleading, as of childhood! You remember his words: \"If I had interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelli .. gent, the so .. called great, or any of their friends, parents, wives or children, it would all have been right. But I believe that to have interfered as I have done, for the despised poor, was not wrong, but right.\" It is easy to see what a favorite he will be with history, which plays such pranks with temporary reputations. Nothing can resist the sympathy which all elevated minds must feel with Brown, and", "to have interfered as I have done, for the despised poor, was not wrong, but right.\" It is easy to see what a favorite he will be with history, which plays such pranks with temporary reputations. Nothing can resist the sympathy which all elevated minds must feel with Brown, and through them the whole civilized world; and if be must suffer, he must drag official gentlemen into an immortality most undesirable, of which they have already some disagreeable forebodings. Indeed, it is the reductio ad absurdum of Slavery, when the governor of Virginia is forced to hang a man whom he declares to be a man of the most integrity, truthfulness and courage he has ever met. Is that the kind of man the gallows is built for? It were bold to affirm that there is within that broad commonwealth, at this moment, another citizen as worthy to live, and as deserving of all public and private honor, as this \u2022 poor prIsoner. But we are here to think of relief for the family of John Brown. To my eyes, that family looks very large and very needy of relief. It comprises his brave fellow sufferers in the Charlestown Jail; the fugitives still hunted in the mountains of Virginia and Pennsylvania; the sympathizers with him in all the states; and, I may say, almost every man who loves the Golden Rule and JOHN BROWN 881 the Declaration of Independence, like him, and who sees what a tiger's thirst threatens him in the malignity of public sentiment in the slave states. It seems to me that a common feeling joins the people of Massachusetts with him. I said John Brown was an idealist .. He believed in his ideas to that extent that he existed to put them all into action;", "in the malignity of public sentiment in the slave states. It seems to me that a common feeling joins the people of Massachusetts with him. I said John Brown was an idealist .. He believed in his ideas to that extent that he existed to put them all into action; he said 'he did not believe in moral suasion, he believed in putting the thing through.' He saw how deceptive the forms are. We fancy, in Massachusetts, that we are free; yet it seems the govern- ment is quite unreliable .. Great wealth, great population, men of talent in the executive, on the bench-all the forms right- and yet, life and freedom are not safe. Why? Because the judges rely on the forms, and do not, like John Brown, use their eyes to see the fact behind the forms. They assume that the United States can protect its witness or its prisoner. And in Massa- chusetts that is true, but the moment he is carried out of the bounds of Massachusetts, the United States, it is notorious, afford no protection at all; the government, the judges, are an envenomed party, and give such protection as they give in Utah to honest citizens, or in Kansas; such protection as they gave to their own Con1modore Paulding, when he was simple enough to mistake the formal instructions of his government for their real meaning. The state judges fear collision between their two allegiances; but there are worse evils than collision; namely, the doing substantial injustice. A good man will see that the use of a judge is to secure good government, and where the citizen's weal is imperilled by abuse of the federal power, to use that arm which can secure it, viz., the local government.

A good man will see that the use of a judge is to secure good government, and where the citizen's weal is imperilled by abuse of the federal power, to use that arm which can secure it, viz., the local government. Had that been done on certain calamitous occasions, we should not have , seen the honor of Massachusetts trailed in the dust, stained to all ages, once and again, by the ill-timed formalism of a venerable bench. If judges cannot find law enough to maintain the sover- eignty of the state, and to protect the life and freedom of every inhabitant not a criminal, it is idle to compliment them as learned and venerable. What avails their learning or venera- tion? At a pinch, they are no more use than idiots. After the mischance they wring their hands, but they had better never 882 J 0 H N B ROW N have been born. A Vermont judge, Hutchinson, who has the Declaratiol1 of Independence in his heart; a Wisconsin judge, who knows that laws are for the protection of citizens against kidnappers, is worth a court-house full of lawyers so idolatrous of forms as to let go the substance. Is any nlan in Massachusetts so simple as to believe that when a United States Court in Virginia, now, in its present reign of terror, scnds to Connecticut, or New York, or Massachusetts, for a witness, it wants him for a witness? No; it wants hiIn for a party; it wants him for meat to slaughter and eat.

But I am detaining the meeting on matters which others un ... derstand better .. I hope, then, that, in adlninistering relief to John Brown's family, we shall remember all those whom his fate concerns, all who are in sympathy with hhn, and not forget to aid him in the best way, by securing freedom and independence in Massachusetts. THE EMANCIPA.TION PROCLAMATION [E1ne1'son spoke with others at a meeting held in Boston in September, 1862, to celebrate the signifi- cance of the E1nancipation Proclamation which Lin- coln had issued on September 22.

Every step in the history of political liberty is a sally of the human mind into the untried Future, and has the interest of genius, and is fruitful in heroic anecdotes. Lib- erty is a slow fruit. It comes, like religion, for short periods, and in rare conditions, as if awaiting a culture of the race which shall make it organic and permanent. Such moments of expan- sion in modern history were the Confession of Augsburg, the plantation of Anlerica, the English Commonwealth of 1648, the Declaration of American Independence in 1776, the British emancipation of slaves in the West Indies, the passage of the Reform Bill, the repeal of the Corn-Laws, the Magnetic Ocean Telegraph, though yet imperfect, the passage of the Homestead Bill in the last Congress, and now, eminently, President Lin- coln's Proclamation on the twenty-second of September. These are acts of great scope, working on a long future and on penna ... nent interests, and honoring alike", "Corn-Laws, the Magnetic Ocean Telegraph, though yet imperfect, the passage of the Homestead Bill in the last Congress, and now, eminently, President Lin- coln's Proclamation on the twenty-second of September. These are acts of great scope, working on a long future and on penna ... nent interests, and honoring alike those who initiate and those who receive them. These measures provoke no noisy joy, but are received into a sympathy so deep as to apprise us that mankind are greater and better than we know. At such times it appears as if a new public were created to greet the new event. It is as when an orator, having ended the compliments and pleasantries with which he conciliated attention, and having run over the superficial fitness and commodities of the measure he urges, sud- denly, lending himself to some happy inspiration, announce~ with vibrating voice the grand human principles involved-the bravos and wits who greeted him loudly thus far are surprised 88~ 886 THE E MAN C I PAT ION PRO C LAM A T ION and overawed; a new audience is found in the heart of the assembly-an audience hitherto passive and unconcerned, now at last so searched and kindled that they come forward, every one a representative of mankind, standing for all nationalities. The extreme moderation with which the President advanced to his design-his long-avowed expectant policy, as if he chose to be strictly the executive of the best public sentiment of the country, waiting only till it should be unmistakably pronounced -so fair a mind that none ever listened so patiently to such extreme varieties of opinion-so reticent that his decision has taken all parties by surprise, whilst yet it is just the sequel of his prior acts-the firm tone in which he announces it, without inflation", "should be unmistakably pronounced -so fair a mind that none ever listened so patiently to such extreme varieties of opinion-so reticent that his decision has taken all parties by surprise, whilst yet it is just the sequel of his prior acts-the firm tone in which he announces it, without inflation or surplusage-all these have bespoken such favor to the act that, great as the popularity of the President has been, we are beginning to think that we have underestimated the ca- pacity and virtue which the Divine Providence has made an in ... strument of benefit so vast. He has been permitted to do more for America than any other American man. He is well entitled to the most indulgent construction. Forget all that we thought shortcomings, every mistake, every delay. In the extreme em .. barrassments of his part, call these endurance, wisdom, magna .. nimity; illuminated, as they now are, by this dazzling success. When we consider the immense opposition that has been neu- tralized or converted by the progress of the war (for it is not long since the President anticipated the resignation of a large number of officers in the army, and the secession of three states, on the promUlgation of this policy)-when we see how the great stake which foreign nations hold in our affairs has recently brought every European power as a client into this court, and it became every day more apparent what gigantic and what remote interests were to be affected by the decision of the President- one can hardly say the deliberation was too long. Against all timorous counsels he had the courage to seize the moment; and such was his position, and such the felicity attending the action, that he has replaced government in the good graces of ma.nkind. \"Better", "the decision of the President- one can hardly say the deliberation was too long.

Life in America had lost much of its attraction in the later years. The virtues of a good magistrate undo a world of mischief, and, because Nature works with rectitude, seem vastly more potent than the acts of bad governors, which are ever tempered by the good nature in the people, and the incessant resistance which fraud and violence encounter. Th\u20ac; acts of good governors work a geometrical ratio, as one midsum ... mer day seems to repair the damage of a year of war. A day which most of us dared not hope to see, an event worth the dreadful war, worth its costs and uncertainties, seems now to be close before us. October, November, December will have passed over beating hearts and plotting brains: then the hour will strike, and all men of African descent who have faculty enough to find their way to our lines are assured of the pro., 1ection of American law.

It is by no means necessary that this measure should be suddenly marked by any signal results on the negroes or on the rebel masters. The force of the act is that it commits the coun- try to this justice-that it compels the innumerable officers, civil, military, naval, of the Republic to range themselves on the line of this equity. It draws the fashion to this side. It is not a lneasure that admits of being taken back. Done, it cannot b~ undone by a new administration. For slavery overpowers thd disgust of the moral sentiment only through immemorial usage_ It cannot be introduced as an improvement of the nineteenth century. This act makes that the lives of our heroes have not been sacrificed in vaill. It makes a victory of our defeats. Our hurts are healed; the health of the nation is repaired. With a victory like this, we can stand many disasters. It does 110t pron1ise the redelnption of the black race; that lies not with us: but it relieves it of our opposition. The President by this act has paroled all the slaves in America; they will no more fight against ( us: and it relieves our race once for all of its crime and false .. position. The first condition of success is secured in putting our- selves right. We have recovered ourselves from our false posi- tion, and planted ourselves on a law of Nature:- 888 THE E MAN C I PAT ION PRO C LAM A T ION \"If that fail, The pillared firmament is rottenness, .

Of course, we are assuming the firmness of the policy thus de- clared. It must not be a paper proclamation. We confide that Mr. Lincoln is in earnest, and as he has been slow in making up his mind, has resisted the importunacy of parties and of events to the latest moment, he will be as absolute in his adhesion.

What if the brokers' quotations show our stocks dis- credited, and the gold dollar costs one hundred and twenty- seven cents? These tables are fallacious. Every acre in the free states gained substantial value on the twenty-second of Sep- tember .. The caU3e of disunion and war has been reached and begun to be removed.

If they go to fill up this yawning Dismal Swamp, which engulfed armies and popu ... lations, and created plague, and neutralized hitherto all the vast capabilities of this continent-then this taxation, which makes the land wholesome and habitable, and will draw all men unto it, is the best investment in which property-holder ever lodged his earnings. Whilst we have pointed out the opportuneness of the Procla- mation, it remains to be said that the President had no choice.

He might look wistfully for what variety of courses lay open to him; every line but one was closed up with fire. This one, too, bristled with danger, but through it was the sole safety. The measure he has adopted was imperative. It is wonderful to see the unseasonable senility of what is called the Peace Party, through all its masks, blinding their eyes to the main feature of the war, namely, its inevitableness. The war existed long before the cannonade of Sumter, and could not be postponed. It might have begun otherwise or elsewhere, but war was in the minds and bones of the combatants, it was written on the- iron leaf, and you might as easily dodge gravitation. If we had consented to a peaceable secession of the rebels, the divided sentiment of the border states made peaceable secession impos .... sible, the insatiable temper of the South made it impossible, and the slaves on the border, wherever the border might be, wer~ an incessant fuel to rekindle the fire. Give the Confederacy New Orleans, Charleston, and Richmond, and they would have demanded St. Louis and Baltimore. Give them these, and they would have insisted on Washington. Give them Washington, and they would have assumed the army and navy, and, through these, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. It looks as if the battle ... field would have been at least as large in that event as it is now. The war was formidable, but could not be avoided.

These necessities which have dictated the conduct of the federal government are overlooked especially by our foreign critics. The popular statement of the opponents of the war abroad is the impossibility of our success. \"If you could add,\" say they, \"to your strength the whole army of England, of France and of Austria, you could not coerce eight millions of people to come under this government against their will.\" This is an odd thing for an Englishman, a Frenchman or an Austrian to say, who remembers Europe of the last seventy, years-the condition of Italy, until 1859-of Poland, since 1793-of France, of French Algiers-of British Ireland, and British India. But granting the truth, rightly read, of the historical aphorism, that \"the peoplE: always conquer,\" it is to be noted that, in the Southern States, the tenure of land and the local laws, with slavery, give the social systeln not a democratic but an aristocratic complexion; and those states have shown every year a more hostile and aggressive temper, until the instinct of self-preservation forced us into the war. And the aim of", "Southern States, the tenure of land and the local laws, with slavery, give the social systeln not a democratic but an aristocratic complexion; and those states have shown every year a more hostile and aggressive temper, until the instinct of self-preservation forced us into the war. And the aim of the war on our part is indicated by the aim of the President's Proclamation, namely, to break IIp the false combination of Southern society, to destroy the piratic feature in it which makes it our enemy only as it is the enemy of the human race, and so allow its reconstruction on a just and healthful basis. Then new affinities will act, the old repulsion will cease, and, the cause of war being removed, Na ... ture and trade may be trusted to establish a lasting peace.

The malignant cry of the Secession press within the free states, al1d the recent action of the Con .... federate Congress, are decisive as to its efficiency and correct- ness of aim.

THOREAU fIENRY DAVID THOREAU was the last male descendant of il French ancestor who came to this country from the Isle of Guernsey - His character exhibited occasional traits drawn from this blood, in singular combination with a very strong Saxon \u2022 genIus. He was born in Concord, Massachusetts, on the 12th of July, 1817- He was graduated at Harvard College in 1837, but with- out any literary distinction. An iconoclast in literature, he seldom thanked colleges for their service to him, holding them in small esteem, whilst yet his debt to them was important. After leaving the University, he joined his brother in teaching a private school, which he soon renounced. His father was a manufacturer of lead-pencils, and Henry applied himself for a time to this craft, believing he could make a better pencil than was then in use. After completing his experiments, he exhibited his work to chemists and artists in Boston, and", "private school, which he soon renounced. His father was a manufacturer of lead-pencils, and Henry applied himself for a time to this craft, believing he could make a better pencil than was then in use. After completing his experiments, he exhibited his work to chemists and artists in Boston, and having obtained their certifi- cates to its excellence and to its equality with the best London manufacture, he returned home contented. His friends congratu- lated him that he had now opened his way to fortune. But he replied that he should never make another pencil. '(Why should I? I would not do again what I have done once.\" He resumed his endless walks and miscellaneous studies, making every day some new acquaintance with Nature, though as yet never speaking of zoology or botany, since, thougb very studious of natural facts, he was incurious of technical and textual science. At this time, a strong, healthy youth, fresh from college, whilst all his companions were choosing their profession, or eager to begin some lucrative employment, it was inevitable that his thoughts should be exercised on the same question, and it required rare decision to refuse all the accustomed paths and keep his solitary freedom at the cost of disappointing the naturaJ 895 THOREAU expectations of his family and friends: all the more difficult that he had a perfect probity, was exact in securing his own inde- pendence, and in holding every man to the like duty_ But Thoreau never faltered. He was a born protestant. He de .. clined to give up his large ambition of knowledge and action for any narrow craft or profession, aiming at a ll1uch more comprehensive calling, the art of living well. If he slighted and defied the opinions of others, it was only that he was", "a born protestant. He de .. clined to give up his large ambition of knowledge and action for any narrow craft or profession, aiming at a ll1uch more comprehensive calling, the art of living well. If he slighted and defied the opinions of others, it was only that he was more intent to reconcile his practice with his own belief. Never idle or self- indulgent, he preferred, when he wanted money, earning it by some piece of manual labor agreeable to him, as building a boat or a fence, planting, grafting, surveying or other short work, to any long engagements. With his hardy habits and few wants, his skill in wood-craft, and his powerful arithmetic, he was very competent to live in any part of the world. It would cost him less time to supply his wants than another _ He was therefore secure of his leisure. . A natural skill for mensuration, growing out of his mathe- matical knowledge and his habit of ascertaining the measures and distances of objects which interested him, the size of trees, the depth and extent of ponds and rivers, the height of moun .. tains and the air-line distance of his favorite summits-this, and his intimate knowledge of the territory about Concord, made him drift into the profession of land .. surveyor. It had the advantage for him that it led him continually into new and secluded grounds, and helped his studies of Nature. His accuracy and skill in this work were readily appreciated, and he found all the employment he wanted. He could easily solve the problems of the surveyor, but hE. was daily beset with graver questions, which he manfully con- fronted. He interrogated every custom, and wished to settle all his practice on an ideal foundation. He was a protestant", "appreciated, and he found all the employment he wanted. He could easily solve the problems of the surveyor, but hE. was daily beset with graver questions, which he manfully con- fronted. He interrogated every custom, and wished to settle all his practice on an ideal foundation. He was a protestant a outrance, and few lives contain so many renunciations. He was bred to no profession; he never married; he lived alone; he never went to church; he never voted; he refused to pay a tax to the State; he ate no flesh, he drank no wine, he never knew the use of tobacco; and, though a naturalist, he used neither I r THOREAU trap nor gun. He chose, wisely no doubt for himself, to be the bachelor of thought and Nature. He had no talent for wealth, and knew how to be poor without the least hint of squalor ot inelegance. Perhaps he fell into his way of living without fore ... casting it much, but approved it with later wisdom. \"I am often reminded,\" he wrote in his journal, \"that if I had bestowed on me the wealth of Crcesus, my aims must be still the same, and my means essentially the same.\" He had no temptations to fight against-no appetites, no passIons, no taste for elegant trifles. A fine house, dress, the manners and talk of highly culti ... vated people were all thrown away on him .. He much preferred a good Indian, and considered these refinements as impediments to conversation, wishing to meet his companion on the simplest terms. He declined invitations to dinner-parties, because there each was in everyone's way, and he could not meet the indi ... viduals to any purpose. \"They make their pride,\" he said, 'lin making their dinner cost much; I", "as impediments to conversation, wishing to meet his companion on the simplest terms. He declined invitations to dinner-parties, because there each was in everyone's way, and he could not meet the indi ... viduals to any purpose. \"They make their pride,\" he said, 'lin making their dinner cost much; I make my pride in making my dinner cost little/' When asked at table what dish he pre, ferred, he answered, \"The nearest.\" He did not like the taste of wine, and never had a vice in his life. He said-HI have a faint recollection of pleasure derived from smoking dried lily- stems, before I was a man. I had commonly a supply of these. I have never smoked anything more noxious.\" He chose to be rich by making his wants few, and supplying them himself. In his travels, he used the railroad only to get over so much country as was unimportant to the present pur- pose, walking hundreds of miles, avoiding taverns, buying a lodging in farmers' and fishermen's houses, as cheaper, and more agreeable to him, and because there he could better find the men and the information he wanted. There was somewhat military in his nature, not to be sub ... dued, always manly and able, but rarely tender, as if he did not feel himself except in opposition. He wanted a fallacy to expose, a blunder to pillory, I may say requiTed a little sense of vic- tory, a roll of the drum, to call his powers into full exercise. It cost him nothing to say No; indeed he found it much easier than to say Yes. It seemed as if his first instinct on hearing a 898 THOREAU proposition was to controvert it, so hnpatient was he of the limitations of our daily thought. This", "powers into full exercise. It cost him nothing to say No; indeed he found it much easier than to say Yes. It seemed as if his first instinct on hearing a 898 THOREAU proposition was to controvert it, so hnpatient was he of the limitations of our daily thought. This habit, of course, is a little chilling to the social affections; and though the companion would in the end acquit him of any malice or untruth, yet it mars conversation. Hence, no equal companion stood in affectionate relations with one so pure and guileless. \"I love Henry,\" said one of his friends, \"but I cannot like him; and as for taking his arm, I should as so.on think of taking the arm of an elm-tree.\" Yet, hermit and stoic as he was, he was really fond of sym- pathy, and threw himself heartily and childlike into the com- pany of young people whom he loved, and whom he delighted to entertain, as he only eQuId, with the varied and endless anec- dotes of his experiences by field and river: and he was always ready to lead a huckleberry-party or a search for chestnuts or grapes. Talking, one day, of a public discourse, Henry reluarked that whatever succeeded with the audience was bad. I said, \"Who would not like to write something which all can read, like Robinson Crusoe? and who does not see with regret that his page is not solid with a right materialistic treatment, which delights everybody?\" Henry objected, of course, and vaunted the better lectures which reached only a few persons. But, at supper, a young girl, understanding that he was to lecture at the Lyceum, sharply asked him, \"Whether his lecture would be a nice, interesting story, such as she wished to hear, or whether it", "objected, of course, and vaunted the better lectures which reached only a few persons. But, at supper, a young girl, understanding that he was to lecture at the Lyceum, sharply asked him, \"Whether his lecture would be a nice, interesting story, such as she wished to hear, or whether it was one of those old philosophical things that she did not care about.\" Henry turned to her, and bethought him- self, and, I saw, was trying to believe that he had matter that might fit her and her brother, who were to sit up and go to the lecture, if it was a good one for them. He was a speaker and actor of the truth, born such, and was ever running into dramatic situations from this cause. In any circumstance it interested all bystanders to know what part Henry would take, and what he would say; and he did not dis- appoint expectation, but used an original judgment on each emergency. In r845 be built himself a small framed house on the shores of Walden Pond, and lived there two years alone, a life of labor and study. This action was quite native and fit THOREAU for him. Noone who knew him would tax him with affectation. He was more unlike his neighbors in his thought than in his action. As soon as he had exhausted the advantages of that solitude, he abandoned it. In 1847, not approving some uses to which the public expenditure was applied, he refused to pay his town tax, and was put in jail. A friend paid the tax for him, and he was released. The like annoyance was threatened the next year. But as his friends paid the tax, notwithstanding his protest, I believe he ceased to resist. No opposition or ridi- cule", "to pay his town tax, and was put in jail. A friend paid the tax for him, and he was released. The like annoyance was threatened the next year. But as his friends paid the tax, notwithstanding his protest, I believe he ceased to resist. No opposition or ridi- cule had any weight with him. He coldly and fully stated his opinion without affecting to believe that it was the opinion of the company. It was of no consequence if everyone present held the opposite opinion. On one occasion he went to the University Library to procure some books. The librarian refused to lend them. Mr. Thoreau repaired to the President, who stated to hinl the rules and usages, which permitted the loan of books to resident graduates, to clergymen who were alumni, and to some others resident within a circle of ten miles' radius from' the College. Mr. Thoreau explained to the President that the railroad had destroyed the old scale of distances-that the library was useless, yes, and President and College useless, on the terms of his rules-that the one benefit he owed to the College was its library-that, at this moment, not only his want of books was imperative, but he wanted a large number of books, and assured him that he, Thoreau, and not the librarian, was the proper custodian of these. In short, the President found the petitioner so formidable, and the rules getting to look so ridicu .. lous, that he ended by giving him a privilege which in his hands proved unlimited theleafter. No truer American existed than Thoreau. His preference of his country and condition was genuine, and his aversation from English and European manners and tastes almost reached con- tempt.

His preference of his country and condition was genuine, and his aversation from English and European manners and tastes almost reached con- tempt. He listened impatiently to news or bonmots gleaned from London circles; and though he tried to be civil, these anecdotes fatigued him. The men were all imitating each other, and on a snlall mould. Why can they not live as far apart as possible, and each be a man by himself? What he sought was 900 THOREAU the most energetic nature; and he wished to go to Oregon, not to London. \"In every part of Great Britain,\" he wrote in his diary, \"are discovered traces of the Romans, their funereal urns, their camps, their roads, their dwellings. But New Eng- land, at least, is not based on any Roman ruins. We have not to lay the foundations of our houses on the ashes of a former civilization.\" But idealist as he was, standing for abolition of slavery, aboli .. tion of tariffs, almost for abolition of government, it is needless to say he found himself not only unrepresented in actual pol- itics, but almost equally opposed to every class of reformers. Yet he paid the tribute of his uniforln respect to the Anti .. Slavery party. One man, whose personal acquaintance he had formed, he honored with exceptional regard. Before the first friendly word had been spoken for Captain John Brown, he sent notices to most houses in Concord that he would speak in a public hall on the condition and character of John Brown, on Sunday evening, and invited all people to come. The Re- publican Committee, the Abolitionist Committee, sent him word that it was premature and not advisable.", "he sent notices to most houses in Concord that he would speak in a public hall on the condition and character of John Brown, on Sunday evening, and invited all people to come. The Re- publican Committee, the Abolitionist Committee, sent him word that it was premature and not advisable. He replied-\"I did not send to you for advice, but to announce that I am to speak.\" The hall was filled at an early hour by people of all parties!p and his earnest eulogy of the hero was heard by all respectfully, by many with a sympathy that surprised themselves. It was said of Plotinus that he was ashamed of his body, and 't is very likely he had good reason for it -that his body was a bad servant, and he had not skill in dealing with the material world, as happens often to men of abstract intellect.. But Mr. Thoreau was equipped with a most adapted and serviceable body. He was of short stature, firmly built, of light complexion, 'with strong, serious blue eyes, and a grave aspect-his face covered in the late years with a becoming beard. His senses were acute, his frame well-knit and hardy, his hands strong and skilful in the use of tools. And there was a wonderful fitness of body and mind. He could pace sixteen rods more accurately than another man could measure them with rod and chain. He could find his path in the woods at night, he said, better THOREA'O 901 by his feet than his eyes. He could estimate the measure of a tree very well by his eye; he could estimate the weight of a calf or a pig, like a dealer. From a box containing a bushel or more of loose pencils, he could take up with", "901 by his feet than his eyes. He could estimate the measure of a tree very well by his eye; he could estimate the weight of a calf or a pig, like a dealer. From a box containing a bushel or more of loose pencils, he could take up with his hands fast enough just a dozen pencils at every grasp. He was a good swimmer, runner, skater, boatman, and would probably out ... walk most countrymen in a day's journey. And the relation of body to mind was still finer than we have indicated. He said he wanted every stride his legs made. The length of his walk uni ... formly made the length of his writing. If shut up in the house he did not write at all. He had a strong common sense, like that which Rose Flam ... mock, the weaver's daughter in Scott's romance, commends in her father, as resembling a yardstick, which, whilst it measures dowlas and diaper, can equally well measure tapestry and cloth of gold. He had always a new resource. When I was planting forest trees, and had procured half a peck of acorns, he said that only a small portion of them would be sound, and pro ... ceeded to examine them and select the sound ones. But finding this took time, he said, \"1 think if you put them all into water the good ones will sink;\" which experiment we tried with success. He could plan a garden or a house or a barn; would have been competent to lead a \"Pacific Exploring Expedition;\" could give judicious counsel in the gravest private or public affairs. He lived for the day, not cumbered and mortified by his memory. If he brought you yesterday a new proposition, he would bring you", "a house or a barn; would have been competent to lead a \"Pacific Exploring Expedition;\" could give judicious counsel in the gravest private or public affairs. He lived for the day, not cumbered and mortified by his memory. If he brought you yesterday a new proposition, he would bring you to-day another not less revolutionary. A very industrious man, and setting, like all highly organized men, a high value on his time, he seemed the only man of leisure in town, always ready for any excursion that promised well, or for conversation prolonged into late hours. His trenchant sense -was never stopped by his rules of daily prudence, but was always up to the new occasion. He liked and used the simplest food, vet, when some one urged a vegetable diet, Thoreau thought. all diets a very small matter, saying that \"the man who shoots the buffalo lives better than the man who boards at the Graham 902 THOREAU House.\" He said-\"You can sleep near the railroad, and never be disturbed: Nature knows very well what sounds are worth attending to, and has made up her mind not to hear the railroad .. \"Thistle. But things respect the devout mind, and a mental ecstasy 'Nas never interrupted.\" He noted what repeatedly befell him, th~t, after receiving from a. distance a rare plant, he would presently find the same in his own haunts. And those pieces of luck which happen only to good players happened to him. One day, walking with a stranger, who inquired where Indian arrow .. heads could be found, he replied, \"Everywhere,\" and, stooping forward, picked one on the instant from the ground. At Mount Washington, in Tuckerman's RavIne, Thoreau had a bad fall, and sprained his foot.

At Mount Washington, in Tuckerman's RavIne, Thoreau had a bad fall, and sprained his foot. As he was in the act of getting up from his fall, he saw for the first time the leaves of the Arnica mollis. His robust common sense, armed with stout hands, keen per ... ceptions and strong will, cannot yet account for the superiority which shone in his simple and hidden life. I must add the car- dinal fact, that there was an excellent wisdom in him, proper to a rare class of men, which showed him the material world as a means and symbol. This discovery, which sometimes yields to poets a certain casual and interrupted light, serving for the ornament (If their writing, was in him an unsleeping insight; and whateveJ~ Iu11Its or obstructions of temperalnent might cloud it, he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. In his youth, he said, one -nay, \"The other world is all my art; my pencils will draw n() other; my jack-knife will cut nothing else; I do not use it ;lS a means.\" This was the muse and geniu-s that ruled his opinio\"ns, conversation, studies, work and course of life. This madf. him a searching judge of men. At first glance he measured ldis companion, and, though insens;ible to some fine traits of (:ulture, could very well report hi~ weight and calibre.

He understood the matter in hand at a glance, and saw the limitations and poverty of those he talked with, so that nothing seemed concealed from such terrible eyes. I have repeatedly known young men of sensibility converted in a moment to th9 THOREAU belief that this was the man they were in search of, the man nf men, who could tell thelTI all they should do. His own dealing with them was never affectionate, but superior, didactic, scorn ... ing their petty ways-very slowly conceding, or not conceding at all, the promise of his s0ciety at their houses, or even at his own. \"Would he not walk with them?\" '~He did not know. There was nothing so important to him as his walk; he had no walks to throwaway on company.)' Visits were offered him ~~rom re ... spectful parties, but he declined ther~. Admiring friends offered to carry him at their own cost to the Yellowstone Rivet-to the West Indies-to South America. But though nothing could be more grave or considered than his refusals, they remind one, in quite new relations, of that fop Brummel's reply to the gentleman who offered him his carriage in a shower, \"But where will you ride, then?\"-and what accusing silences, and what searching and irresistible speeches, battering down all defences, his companions can remember 1 Mr. Thoreau dedicated his genius with such entire love to the fields, hills and waters of his native town, thallt he made them known and interesting to all reading Alnericans, and to people over the sea.

The river on whose banks he was born and died he knew from its springs to its confluence with the Merrimack.. He had Inade summer and winter observations on it for many years, and at every hour of the day and night. The result of the recent survey of the Water Commissioners appointed by the State of Massachusetts he had reached by his private experi .. ments, several years earlier. Every fact which occurs in the bed, on the banks or in the air over it; the fishes, and their spawn ing and nests, their manners, their food; the shad-flies which fill the air on a certain evening once a year, and which are snapped at by the fishes so ravenously that many of these die of reple- tion; the conical heaps of small stones on the river-shallows, the huge nests of small fishes, one of which will sometimes overfill a cart; the birds which frequent the stream, heron, duck, sheldrake, loon, osprey; the snake, muskrat, otter, wood .. chuck and fox, on the banks; the turtle, frog, hyla and cricket, which make the banks vocal-were all known to him, and, as it THOREAU :wreref ~townsmen and fellow creatures; so that he felt an ab .. surdity or violence in any narrative of one of these by itself 'apart, and still more of its dimensions on an inch-rule, or in the exhibition of its skeleton, or the specimen of a squirrel or a bird in brandy.

He liked to speak of the manners of the river, as itself a lawful creature, yet with exactness, and always to an observed fact. As he knew the river, so the ponds in this region. One of the weapons he used, more important to him than microscope, or alcohol-receiver to other investigators, was a whim which grew on him by indulgence, yet appeared in gravest statement, namely, of extolling his own town and neighborhood as the most favored centre for natural observation. He remarked that the Flora of Massachusetts embraced almost all the im- portant plants of America-most of the oaks, most of the willows, the best pines, the ash, the maple, the beech, the nuts. He returned Kane's Arctic Voyage to a friend of whom he had borrowed it, with the remark, that \"Most of the phenomena noted might be observed in Concord.\" He seemed a little envious of the Pole, for the coincident sunrise and sunset, or five minutes' day after six: months: a splendid fact, which Annursnuc had never afforded him. He found red snow in one of his walks, and told me that he expected to find yet the Victoria regia in Concord. He was the attorney of the indigenous plants, and owned to a preference of the weeds to the imported plants, as of the Indian to the civilized man, and noticed, with pleasure, that the willow bean-poles of his neighbor had grown more than his beans. \"See these weeds,\" he said, \"which have been hoed at by a million farmers all spring and summer, and yet have prevailed, and just now come out triumphant over all lanes, pastures, fields and gardens, such is", "that the willow bean-poles of his neighbor had grown more than his beans. \"See these weeds,\" he said, \"which have been hoed at by a million farmers all spring and summer, and yet have prevailed, and just now come out triumphant over all lanes, pastures, fields and gardens, such is their vigor. We have insulted them with low names, too-as Pigweed, Wormwood, Chickweed, Shad-blossom.\" He says, \"They have brave names, too--Ambrosia, Stellaria, Amelanchier, Amaranth, etc.\" I think. his fancy for referring everything to the meridian of Concord did not grow out of any ignorance or depreciation of other longitudes or latitudes, but was rather a playful expres- sion of his conviction of the indifferency of all places, and that I \\ -, rll : !

He expres~~~ 1\" in this wise: \"1 think nothing is to be hoped from you, if this bit of mould under your feet is not sweeter to you to eat than any other in this world, or in any world~\" The other weapon with which he conquered all obstacles in science was patience. He knew how to sit immovable, a part of the rock he rested on, until the bird, the reptile, the fish, which had retired from him, should come back. and resume its habits, nay, moved by curiosity, should come to him and watch him. It was a pleasure and a privilege to walk with him. He knew the country like a fox or a bird, and passed through it as freely by paths of his own.

He knew the country like a fox or a bird, and passed through it as freely by paths of his own. He knew every track in the snow or on the ground, and what creature had taken this path before him. One must submit abjectly to such a guide, and the reward was great. Under his arm he carried an old music-book to press plants; in his pocket, his diary and pencil, a spy-glass for birds, microscope, jack-knife and twine. He wore a straw bat, stout shoes, strong gray trousers, to brave scrub-oaks and smilax, and to climb a tree for a hawk's or a squirrel's nest. He waded into the pool for the water-plants, and his strong legs were no insignificant part of his armor. On the day I speak of he looked for the Menyanthes, detected it across the wide pool, and, on examination of the florets, decided that it had been in flower five days. He drew out of his breast-pocket his diary, and read the names of all the plants that should bloom on this day, whereof he kept account as a banker when his notes fall due. The Cypripedium not due till to-morrow .. He thought that, if waked up from a trance, in this swamp, he could tell by the plants what time of the year it was within two days. The red .. start was flying about, and presently the fine grosbeaks, whose brilliant scarlet \"makes the rash gazer wipe his eye,\" and whose fine clear note Thoreau compared to that of a tanager which has got rid of its hoarseness .. Presently he heard a note which he called that of the night-warbler, a bird he had never identified, had been in search of twelve years,", "rash gazer wipe his eye,\" and whose fine clear note Thoreau compared to that of a tanager which has got rid of its hoarseness .. Presently he heard a note which he called that of the night-warbler, a bird he had never identified, had been in search of twelve years, which always, when he saw it, was in the act of diving down into a tree or bush, and which it was vain to seek; the only bird which sings indifferently by .' THOREAU night and by day. I told him he must beware of finding and .. booking it, lest life should have nothing more to show him. He said, \"What you seek in vain for, half your life, one day you come full upon, all the family at dinner. You seek it like a dream, and as soon as you find it you become its prey.\" His interest in the flower or the bird lay very deep in his mind, was connected with Nature--and the meaning of Nature was never attempted to be defined by him. He would not offer a memoir of his observations to the Natural History Society. ~'Why should I? To detach the description from its connections in my mind would make it no longer true or valuable to me: and they do not wish what belongs to it.\" His power of ob- servation seemed to indicate additional senses. He saw as with microscope, heard as with ear-trumpet, and his memory was a photographic register of all he saw and heard. And yet none knew better than he that it is not the fact that imports, but the impression or effect of the fact on your mind. Every fact lay in ~lory in his mind, a type of the order and beauty of the whole.", "of all he saw and heard. And yet none knew better than he that it is not the fact that imports, but the impression or effect of the fact on your mind. Every fact lay in ~lory in his mind, a type of the order and beauty of the whole. His determination on Natural History was organic. He con- fessed that he sometimes felt like a hound or a panther, and, if born among Indians, would have been a fell hunter. But, re- strained by his Massachusetts culture, he played out the game in this mild form of botany and ichthyology_ His intimacy with animals suggested what Thomas Fuller records of Butler the apiologist, that \"either he had told the bees things or the bees had told him.\" Snakes coiled round his legs; the fishes swam into his hand, and he took them out of the water; he pulled the woodchuck out of its hole by the tail, and took the foxes under his protection from the hunters. Our naturalist had per- fect magnanimity; he had no secrets: he would carry you to the heron's haunt, or even to his most prized botanical swamp- possibly knowing that you could never find it again, yet willing to take his risks. No college ever offered him. a diploma, or a professor's chair; no academy made him its corresponding secretary, its discoverer or even its member. Perhaps these learned bodies feared the satire of bis presence. Yet so much knowledge of Nature's THOREAU secret and genius few others possessed; none in a more large and religious synthesis. For not a particle of respect had he to the opinions of any man or body of men, but homage solely to the truth itself; and as he discovered everywhere among doctors some leaning of courtesy,", "secret and genius few others possessed; none in a more large and religious synthesis. For not a particle of respect had he to the opinions of any man or body of men, but homage solely to the truth itself; and as he discovered everywhere among doctors some leaning of courtesy, it discredited them. He grew to be revered and admired by his townsmen, who had at first known him only as an oddity. The farmers who employed him as a surveyor soon discovered his rare accuracy and skill, his knowl- edge of their lands, of trees, of birds, of Indian remains and the like, which enabled him to tell every farmer more than he knew before of his own farm; so that he began to feel a little as if Mr. Thoreau had better rights in his land than he. They felt, too, the superiority of character which addressed all men with a native authority. Indian relics abound in Concord-arrow-heads, stone chisels, pestles and fragments of pottery; and on the river ... bank, large heaps of clam-shells and ashes mark spots which the savages frequented. These, and every circumstance touching the In- dian, were important in his eyes. His visits to Maine were chiefly for love of the Indian. He had the satisfaction of seeing the manufacture of the bark canoe, as well as of trying his hand in its management on the rapids. He was inquisitive about the nlaking of the stone arrow .. head, and in his last days charged a youth setting out for the Rocky MOl:lntains to find an Indian who could tell him that: \"It was well worth a visit to Cali- fornia to learn it.\" Occasionally, a small party of Penobscot Indians would visit Concord, and pitch their tents for a few weeks in", "days charged a youth setting out for the Rocky MOl:lntains to find an Indian who could tell him that: \"It was well worth a visit to Cali- fornia to learn it.\" Occasionally, a small party of Penobscot Indians would visit Concord, and pitch their tents for a few weeks in summer QD the river-bank. He failed not to make ac- quaintance with the best of them; though he well knew that asking questions of Indians is like catechizing beavers and rabbits. In his last visit to Maine he had great satisfaction from J()seph Polis, an intelligent Indian of Oldtown, who was his guide for some weeks. He was equally interested in every natural fact. The depth of his perception found likeness of law throughout Nature, and I know not any genius who so swiftly inferred universal law from the ~ingle fact. He was no pedant of a department. His eye was . I THOREAU 'open to beauty, and his ear to music. He found these, not in Irare conditions, but wheresoever he went. He thought the best lof music was in single strains; and he found poetic suggestion in the humming of the telegraph-wire. His poetry might be bad or good; he no doubt wanted a lyric facility and technical skill, but he had the source of poetry in his spiritual perception. He was a good reader and critic, and his judgment on poetry was to the ground of it. He could not be deceived as to the presence or absence of the poetic element in any composition, and his thirst for this made him negligent and perhaps scornful of superficial graces. He would pass by many delicate rhythms, but he would have detected every live stanza or line in a volume and knew very well where to find an", "absence of the poetic element in any composition, and his thirst for this made him negligent and perhaps scornful of superficial graces. He would pass by many delicate rhythms, but he would have detected every live stanza or line in a volume and knew very well where to find an equal poetic charm in prose. He was so enamoured of the spiritUal beauty that he held all actual written poenls in very light esteem in the comparison. He admired Aeschylus and Pindar; but when some one was commending them, he said that Aeschylus and the Greeks, in describing Apollo and Orpheus, had given no song, or no good one .. \"They ought not to have moved trees, but to have chanted to the gods such a hymn as would have . sung all their old ideas out of their heads, and new ones in.\" His own verses are often rude and defective. The gold does not yet run pure, is drossy and crude. The thyme and marjoram are not yet honey. But if he want lyric fineness and technical merits, if he have not the poetic temperament, he never lacks the causal thought, showing that his genius was better than his talent. He knew the worth of the Imagination for the uplifting and consolation of human life, and liked to throw every thought into a symbol. The fact you tell is of no value, but only the impression. For this reason his presence was poetic, always piqued the curiosity to know more deeply the secrets of his mind .. He had many reserves, an unwillingness to exhibit to profane eyes what was still sacred in his own, and knew well how to throw a poetic veil over his experience. All readers of Walden will remember his mythical record of his", "know more deeply the secrets of his mind .. He had many reserves, an unwillingness to exhibit to profane eyes what was still sacred in his own, and knew well how to throw a poetic veil over his experience. All readers of Walden will remember his mythical record of his disappoint- ments:- \"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse and a turtle-dove, and THOREAU am still on their trail. ]\\f any are the travellers I have spoken concerning them, describing their tracks, and what calls they answered to. I have nlet one or two who have heard the hound t and the tramp of the horse, and even seen the dove disappear behind a cloud; ann they seelned as anxious to recover them as if they had lost them themselves.\" His riddles were worth the reading, and I confide that if at any time I do not understand the expression, it is yet just. Such was the wealth of his truth that it was not worth his while to use words in vain. His poem entitled \"Sympathy\" reveals the tenderness under that triple steel of stoicisnl, and the intel- lectual subtility it could animate. His classic pocnl on '~Smoke\" suggests Sin1onides, hut is better than any poenl of Simonides. His biography is in his verses. His habitual thought makes all his poetry a hyn1n to the Cause of causes> the Spirit which vivifies and controls his own:- \"I hearing get, who had but ears, A.nd sight? who had but eyes before; I nl0ments live, who lived but years, And truth dis;cern, who knew but learning's lore.\" And still more in these religious lines:- \"N ow chiefly is my natal hour, And only now n'ly prin1e of life; I will not doubt the love untold, Which not my worth", "but eyes before; I nl0ments live, who lived but years, And truth dis;cern, who knew but learning's lore.\" And still more in these religious lines:- \"N ow chiefly is my natal hour, And only now n'ly prin1e of life; I will not doubt the love untold, Which not my worth nor want have bought, Which wooed nlC young, and WO()~ me old, And to this evening hath me br()tl~ht.H Whilst he used in his writings a certain petulance 0 f relnark in reference to churches or churchmen, he ,vas a person of a rare, tender and absolute religion, a person incapable of any profanation, by act or by thought. ()f courRC, the san1e is()la~ tion which belonged to his original thinking and living de ... tached him from the social religious forrns. This is neither to be censured nor regretted. Aristotle long ago explained it, when he said, \"One who surpasses his fellow citizens in virtue is no , I, 9IO THOREAU longer a part of the city. Their law is not for him, since he is a law to himself.\" Thoreau was sincerity itself, and might fortify the convic- tions of prophets in the ethical laws by his holy living. It was an affirmative experience which refused to be set aside. A truth ... speaker he, capable of the most deep and strict conversation; a physician to the wounds of any soul; a friend, knowing not only the secret of friendship, but almost worshipped by those few persons who resorted to him as their confessor and prophet, and knew the deep value of his mind and great heart. He thought that without religion or devotion of some kind nothing great was ever accomplished: and he thought that the bigoted ,sectarian bad better bear this in mind. His virtues, of", "resorted to him as their confessor and prophet, and knew the deep value of his mind and great heart. He thought that without religion or devotion of some kind nothing great was ever accomplished: and he thought that the bigoted ,sectarian bad better bear this in mind. His virtues, of course, sometimes ran into extremes. It was easy to trace to the inexorable demand on all for exact truth that austerity which made this willing hermit more solitary even than he wished. Himself of a perfect probity, he required not less of others. He had a disgust at crime, and no worldly success would cover it. He detected paltering as readily in digni .. fled and prosperous persons as in beggars, and with equal scorn. Such dangerous frankness was in his dealing that his admirers called hin1 \"that terrible Thoreau,\" as if he spoke when silent, and was still present when be had departed. I think the severity of his ideal interfered to deprive him of a healthy sufficiency of human society. The habit of a realist to find things the reverse of their ap- pearance inclined him to put every statement in a paradox. A certain habit of antagonism defaced his earlier writings-a trick of rhetoric not quite outgrown in his later, of substituting f()r the obvious word and thought its diametrical opposite. He praised wild mountains and winter forests for their domestic air, in snow and ice he would find sultriness, and commended the wilderness for resembling Rome and Paris. \"It was so dry, that you might call it wet.\" The tendency to magnify the moment, to read all the laws of Nature in the one object or one combination under your eye, is of course comic to those who do not share the philosopher's Tl-IOREAU 911 .,erception", "and Paris. \"It was so dry, that you might call it wet.\" The tendency to magnify the moment, to read all the laws of Nature in the one object or one combination under your eye, is of course comic to those who do not share the philosopher's Tl-IOREAU 911 .,erception of identity.

His study of Nature was a perpetual ornament to him, and inspired his friends with curiosity to see the world through his eyes, and to hear his adventures. They possessed every kind of interest .. He had many elegancies of his own, whilst he scoffed at con ... ventional elegance. Thus, he could not bear to hear the sound of his own steps, the grit of gravel; and therefore never willingly walked in the road, but in the grass, on mountains and in woods. His senses were acute, and he remarked that by night every dwelling-house gives out bad air, like a slaughter-\\house. He liked the pure fragrance of melilot. He honored certain plants with special regard, and, over all, the pond-liIy-then, the 912 THOREAU gentian, and the Mikania scandens, and \"life .. everlasting,\" and a bass-tree which he visited every year when it bloomed, in thf middle of July.

Row slowly, and yet by bappily gi' 918 ABRAHAM LINCOLN prepared steps, he came to his place. All of us rcmember- it !s only a history of five or six years-the surprise and the disappointment of the country at his first nomination by the convention at Chicago. Mr. Seward, then in the culmination of his good fame, was the favorite of the Eastern States. And when the new and comparatively unknown name of Lincoln was announced (notwithstanding the report of the acclamations of that convention), we heard the result coldly and sadly. It seemed too rash, on a purely local reputation, to build so grave a trust in such anxious times; and men naturally talked of the chances in politics as incalculable. But it turned out not to be chance. The profound good opinion which the people of Illinois and of the West had conceived of hinl, and which they bad imparted to their colleagues, that they also might justify themselves to their constituents at home, was not rash, though they did not begin to know the riches of his worth.

He offered no shining qualities at the first encounter; he did not offend by superiority. He had a face and manner which disarmed suspicion, which inspired confidence, which confirmed good will. He was a man without vices. He had a strong sense of duty, which it was very easy for him to obey. Then, he had what farmers call a long head; was excellent in working out the sum for himself; in arguin,g his case and convincing you fairly and firmly .. Then, it turned out that he was a great worker; had prodigious faculty of performance; worked easily. A good worker is so rare; everybody has some disabling quality. In a host of young men that start together and promise so many brilliant leaders for the next age, each fails on trial; one by bad health, one by conceit, or by love of pleasure, or lethargy, or an ugly . temper-each has some disqualifying fault that throws him out of the career. But this man was sound to the core, cheerful, persistent, all right for labor, and liked nothing so well. Then, he had a vast good nature, which made him tolerant and accessible to all; fair-minded, leaning to the claim of the peti- tioner; affable, and not sensible to the affliction which the in- numerable visits paid to him when President would have brought A BRA li A.1\\1: LIN COL N to anyone else.

The times have allowed no state secrets; the nation has been in 8uch ferment, such multitudes had to be trusted, that no secret could be kept. Every door was ajar, and we know all that befell. Then, what an occasion was the whirlwind of the war. Here was place for no holiday magistrate, ~o fair-weather sailor; the new pilot was hurried to the helm in a tornado. In four years- four years of battle-days-his endurance, his fertility of re- sources, his magnanimity, were sorely tried and never found wanting. There, by his courage, his justice, his even temper, his fertile counsel, his humanity, he stood a heroic figure in the centre of a heroic epoch. He is the true history of the American people in his time. Step by step he walked before thenl; slow with their slowness, quickening his march by theirs, the true representative of this continent; an entirely public man; father of his\u00b7 country, the pulse of twenty millions throbbing in his heart, the thought of their minds articulated 7)y his tongue.

Far happier this fate than to have lived to be wished away; to have watched the decay of his own faculties; to have seen-perhaps even he-the pro- verbial ingratitude of statesmen; to have seen Inean men pre- ferred. Had he not lived long enough to keep the greatest prom ... ise that ever man made to his fellow men-the practical abolition ABRAHAM LINCOLN of slavery? He had seen Tennessee, Missouri and Maryland emancipate their slaves. He had seen Savannah, Charleston and Richmond surrendered; had seen the main army of the rebellion lay down its arnlS. He had conquered the public opinion of Canada, England and France. Only Washington can compare with him in fortune.

The ancients believed in a serene and beautiful Genius which ruled in the affairs of nations; which, with a slow but stern justice, carried forward the fortunes of certain chosen houses, weeding out single offenders or offending families, and securing at last the fIrm prosperity of the favorites of Heaven. It was too narrow a view of the Eternal Nemesis. There is a serene Providence which rules the fate of nations, which makes little account of time, little of one generation or race, makes no ac .. count of disasters, conquers alike by what is called defeat or by what is called victory, thrusts aside enemy and obstruction, crushes everything immoral as inhuman, and obtains the ulti- mate triumph of the best race by the sacrifice of everything which resists the moral laws of the world. It makes its own instruments, creates the man for the time, trains him in poverty, inspires his genius, and arms him for his task. It has given every race its own talent, and ordains that only that race which combines perfectly with the virtues of all shall endure.

He bates a literary trifler, and if, after Guizot had been a tool of Louis Philippe for years, he is now to come and write essays on the character of Washington, on \"The Beautiful\" and on 4'Philosophy of History,\" he thinks that nothing. Great is his reverence for realities-for all such traits as spring from the intrinsic nature of the actor. He humors this into the idolatry of strength. A strong nature has a charm for him, previous, it would seem, to all inquiry whether the force be divine or diabolic. He preaches, as by cannonade, the doctrine that every noble nature was made by God, and contains, if savage passions, also fit checks and grand impulses, and, how .. ever extravagant, will keep its orbit and return from far. Nor can that decorum which is the idol of the Englishman, and in attaining which the Englishman exceeds all nations, win from him any obeisance. He is eaten", "if savage passions, also fit checks and grand impulses, and, how .. ever extravagant, will keep its orbit and return from far. Nor can that decorum which is the idol of the Englishman, and in attaining which the Englishman exceeds all nations, win from him any obeisance. He is eaten up with indignation against such as desire to make a fair show in the flesh. Combined with this warfare on respectabilities, and, indeed, pointing all his satire, is the severity of his moral sentiment. In proportion to the peals of laughter amid which he strips the plumes of a pretender and shows the lean hypocrisy to every vantage of ridicule, does he worship whatever enthusiasm, forti- tude, love or other sign of a good nature is in a man. There is nothing deeper in his constitution than his humor, than the considerate, condescending good nature with which he looks at every object in existence, as a man might look at a mouse. He feels that th~ perfection of health is sportiveness, and will not look grave even at dulness or tragedy. His guiding genius is his moral sense, his perception of the sole importance of truth and justice; but that is a truth of character, not of catechisms. He says, \"There is properly no religion in England. These idle nobles at Tattersall's-there is no work or word of serious purpose in them; they have this great lying Church; and life is a humbug.\".He prefers Cambridge to Oxford, but he thinks Oxford and Cambridge education indurates the young men, as the Styx hardened Achilles\" so that when they CARLVx..'~ come forth of them, they say, (\\~()W wr- art' pro()f~ We\" ha\\'r ;,~on,f' through all the degrees, and ar(~ (:ast~ .. hanl~\u00b7np~' aJ(alll~t I hC~,\\'l'r i\\l, &11 ties of the Universe; nor", "Oxford and Cambridge education indurates the young men, as the Styx hardened Achilles\" so that when they CARLVx..'~ come forth of them, they say, (\\~()W wr- art' pro()f~ We\" ha\\'r ;,~on,f' through all the degrees, and ar(~ (:ast~ .. hanl~\u00b7np~' aJ(alll~t I hC~,\\'l'r i\\l, &11 ties of the Universe; nor nu~n nor (,;of! can pt\u00b7Jlt\u00b7t,fatf~ u~~.
