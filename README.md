# amstud-repo

This repository contains the backend of my RAG Engine, which includes the entire RAG System as well as a Flask-created API that is called by the frontend. This runs locally, and for the frontend to work, this needs to be running. To publish this backend, I would have to pay for cloud resources. Thus, I have decided to keep this a local project. If you wish to see the entire project in action, come to me and I will show you.
